Means, standard deviations, and the results of the univariate ANOVAs are presented in Table 3.Finally, we tested whether the assessment of the quality of foster care moderates the effects of the workers' attitudes toward removal to foster care on their recommended intervention.

They draw attention to important issues, but the reader should bear in mind that different and equally impor- tant issues would emerge if a similar exercise were undertaken with other participants.Quality of decision-makingThe following concerns emerged about the way that decisions are reached in the care proceedings process:∑ The game-like aspects of the process can lead tocompromises that do not truly address the best interests of children. This occurs if influential play- ers are motivated by the desire to score points or by other purely personal needs that (perhaps as a result of lack of supervision) supplant or become confused with the needs of the child. (Compare one of Dickens’ social work manager informants: ‘The child got lost in the process of the legal game’; Dickens 2006, p. 82.)∑ Too much weight was given to the opinions of par- ticipants whose knowledge of the case and/or recent experience of actually implementing plans was limited.∑ There was a lack of time for the social workers themselves to truly ‘get to know’ the children.∑ Long-term patterns were too readily discounted in the light of limited evidence from new assessments, sometimes carried out in very artificial conditions. The latter occurred for a variety of reasonsincluding:∑ A tendency on the part of all participants (includingsocial workers themselves) to distrust second-hand information and to want to look at the situation anew themselves.∑ The fact that those best placed to observe long-term patterns are often of relatively low status, including unqualified staff and social workers themselves.∑ Social workers, particularly in complex cases, may not have time to properly consider the available written evidence – or it may simply be unavailable.Bias towards ‘safety’We referred earlier to comments suggesting a bias towards removing children as against leaving them in situations where there was some risk. We also noted that going to court has its attractions: it is exciting and has a clear ‘structure’ (Hilltown B). As social workers choosing to resist the court route are also placing themselves in a position where failure could result in public disgrace – UK social workers do tend to see a media lynching as their likely fate if they fail to protect children – we do not find it hard to see why choosing care proceedings could, in borderline situations, be the more attractive option. Perhaps this is a dynamic that helps to account for the increasing numbers of care proceedings being brought to court.The problem of expertiseWe do not have to agree with Hilltown D that social workers alone ‘should be able to say what is in the best interests of the children’ to recognize that distor- tions and delays will occur in the decision-making process if the expertise of any participant is either over- or undervalued. In the UK, recent miscarriages of justice resulting from excessive weight being placed on the evidence of a paediatrician, Professor Roy Meadow, are examples of expert evidence being over- valued, though, as The Observer newspaper commented:Meadow’s [case] highlights the enormous difficulties involved in being a witness in highly complex cases where giving your opinion may be treated as cast-iron fact . . . Currently, doc- tors are all too often trapped by an adversarial system into presenting evidence as black or white when, in truth, it may be grey. (The Observer 2005)In a discussion on the difficulties for judges and welfare officials in reaching decisions in matrimonial custody cases, Jon Elster refers to a ‘psychological tension in decision makers that many will be unable to tolerate’, resulting from the gravity of the decision taken together with the lack of an incontrovertible way of making it. He suggests that some resolve this ‘by an irrational belief in the possibility of rational pref- erence’ (Elster 1989, p. 124), a belief that, given enough information and expertise, an incontro- vertibly ‘right’ answer will emerge. Although care";Beckett, McKeigue, Taylor - 2007 - Coming to conclusions social workers’ perceptions of the decision-making process in care proceeding.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=494 end=4603 startpage=7 endpage=7;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Beckett & McK- eigue (2003) describe one striking example of a single expert, on the basis of very limited direct knowledge of a case, being allowed to overturn an established consensus, with disastrous results.Some observers might be inclined to dismiss the complaints of social workers about the deference shown to the views of experts and guardians as pro- fessional jealousy. But they actually raise important questions about the meaning and limits of expertise in this area. Poor decisions and unnecessary delays will result if courts have an inflated idea of the level of certainty that any professional can reasonably achieve.DelayTo actually come to a conclusion carries the risk of discovering that one’s conclusion is wrong, and this creates an incentive to delay. However, it would appear that the protocol has had some success in creating a new set of incentives. Social workers did feel under pressure to bring things to a rapid conclu- sion and they did see at least some evidence that courts are being tougher on known causes of delay such as requests for additional assessments or new parties joining proceedings at a late stage. If this trans- lated into quicker decision-making, this should be good news for children, although, as Daletown E noted, we need to remember that delay in court is not the only obstacle in the way of long-term resolution. [An American study (Bishop et al. 1992) found that court proceedings were the middle part of a much longer period of uncertainty. A Northern Irish report made the related point that the length of proceedings per se is not necessarily the issue, so much as the length of time that a child spends in temporary care arrangements (McSherry et al. 2004).] And there were concerns that tight deadlines could lead to prob- lems with the quality of the work.CONCLUSIONIt is not easy to design a process that will both deliver the best possible answers to complex and very impor- tant questions, and do so quickly. We would be foolish to suggest detailed changes on the basis of the limited and partial view presented here.62 Child and Family Social Work 2007, 12, pp 54–63However, one important point to make is that it may be mistaken to assume that there is necessarily always a trade-off between the quality of decision- making and its speed. Our findings suggest that there are a number of factors in the present system that may cause both delay and inferior decision-making.First, the system would be more likely to yield both better and quicker decisions if it were less adversarial, because this would reduce the game-playing aspects of the current process that can intrude on rational consideration of the child’s best interests.Second, if all participants were well supported rather than acting in isolation, this would also be likely to result both in quicker and in better outcomes, as personal agendas and anxiety-reducing distortions would then be less likely to intrude.Third, failure to properly utilize information from the past is also likely both to cause delay and to result in inferior decisions being made. To adapt a well- known aphorism: Those who neglect the past may be condemning children and parents to repeat it.;Beckett, McKeigue, Taylor - 2007 - Coming to conclusions social workers’ perceptions of the decision-making process in care proceeding.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=90 end=3558 startpage=8 endpage=8;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

They understood the need to pay due regard to the demands of procedure and protocol, but work did not stop there. They described an iterative process of moving back and forth between the demands of procedure and the demands of the case, the case being all those ‘real-world’ details that arise in the context of the practice of social work but which are left out of standardised question-and-answer formats. From detailed analysis of the data-sets, we have condensed the informal logics of risk management into the following three key elements:(1) The logics of risk-management strategies are emergent/contingent; they arise in relation to particular cases as reflexive, individualised and tai- lored responses.(2) Risk assessment practices are embedded in social relations—team culture, client–worker relationships that create unique contingencies, but also habitual responses.(3) A multiplicity of rationalities operate, concerning not just instrumental matters, but human virtues of compassion, empathy and a sense of moral responsibility for others.Selected case examples are provided below. Each case illustrates all three elements of the informal logics of risk that we describe in our statements. The case studies all display in different ways the interplay of formal and informal risk-management strategies that we observed.Case Example 1This first case example draws on an interview with a student social worker placed in a ‘Children with Disabilities’ team. The student talks about mana- ging risk with respect to a specific family, focusing on the difficulty of";Broadhurst et al. - 2010 - Risk, instrumentalism and the humane project in social work Identifying the informal logics of risk managemen.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=845 end=2531 startpage=6 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

The workers describe the process of undertaking a pre-birth assessment in a case that is highly emotive and complicated by tensions and contractions between the team’s risk assessments and those of collaborating agencies.The focus group participants outline the case:Participant 1 (health visitor): . . . she’d (the mother) had another family that she’d dumped.Participant 2 (school nurse): . . . she’d 2 children already, but because the conditions of his release (from prison) were that he couldn’t return to his home town, she left her own children to come and be with him here in X town.Participant 1: . . . she’d pretty much abandoned her own children with differ- ent family members to come over here. She’d no history with social services before regarding her children, so there really there were no major concerns about her parenting, . . . wasn’t any major concerns about her parenting.Participant 2: . . . but it was the fact that she willingly entered a relationship, knowing that he was a murderer, got herself pregnant and married within the space of literally a few months of his release!Participant 1: . . . and knowing that he’d murdered the mother of his own children, in front of those children!This initial description of the case largely centres on the mother. She has abandoned her children for a murderer—a morally perplexing response given the workers’ normative understandings about ‘good motherhood’. With no prior history on this mother, assessing and evidencing risk was par- ticularly difficult. The risk assessment was further complicated by the pro- bation assessment:Participant 3 (family support worker): . . . he’d served 12 years inside and then was out on life license, because he’d made such good progress, so as far as probation was concerned he was low risk. He had been rehabilitated, considered low risk, low risk to the population as a whole. And this was par- ticularly horrendous for our team, because from other professionals’ points of view, particularly probation, they couldn’t understand our concerns. He’d done his rehabilitation.There are differences between child protection and probation risk concerns and conclusions.

However, the impact of emotions, interwoven with the passing of time and strength of voice, emerged most powerfully. The extracts presented below reflect these three themes.Impact of emotionsEmotional responses and triggers, relationship dynamics and practice con- texts were identified as interacting in decision making. An observable dif- ference in the data was the capacity of qualified practitioners to identify and express significant emotions about service users. Recognition of em- pathic and negative feelings and their potential to influence behaviour was overtly acknowledged and noted as a source of power, regardless of or- ganisational constraints:Often the decision is not about policies and procedures . . .. It’s about per- sonality; it’s about feelings, emotions, power . . . you know (Qualified Prac- titioner FG3).But sometimes we do feel more for some clients in some situations than we do for others, and certain personalities and situations might hit on some- thing that is personal for us. And you want to try that much harder. . . . To maybe go that extra mile...and other times you kind of think, ‘Okay, okay, my Manager has decided’ (Qualified Practitioner FG4).Both qualified and student practitioner discourse reflected feelings which were arguably in conflict with anti-oppressive values but which reflected their lived experience of decision making in practice. There was recognition that some service users trigger personal experiences or responses that may result in the practitioner ‘going that extra mile’, such as to challenge a man- agement decision regarding resources or conversely to comply more readily with such a decision due to negative feelings about that individual client. Qualified practitioners expressed more concerns about the extent to which such feelings directly influenced actions:[Serviceusers]...Ican’twarmto...IhopethatIwouldnever...butI’msure it must play in my . . .—I’m sure it does (011) (Qualified Practitioner FG3).While student practitioners expressed care for service users, their expressed feelings tended to focus on themselves, the impact of decisions they witnessed and were involved in, the stress, pressure and ‘scared’ feel- ings encountered in this process:. . . if you’re stressed and under pressure your decision-making is going to be affected by that basically and whether you can be bothered to really put the time and effort into a particular case (Student Practitioner (postgradu- ate) FG2).Downloaded from http://bjsw.oxfordjournals.org/ at Bolland Library, UWE Bristol on January 20, 2014";Connor, Leonard - 2013 - Decision Making in Children and Families Social Work The Practitioner ’ s Voice.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=66 end=2704 startpage=6 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018
9:289;The temporal nature of professional development and social work practice in responding to and assess…;The temporal nature of professional development and social work practice in responding to and assessing service users’ circumstances which are fluid and contextual emerged as a core theme. The passing of time was identified as crucial in relation to perceptions of decision making, relating to practi- tioner and service user experiences of ‘lived time’ and organisational and policy constructions of time. As qualified practitioners have greater length of experience, this resulted in a much wider range of case-based de- cision making being discussed. Their sense of time in the workplace varies to that of students, who are on a prescribed time-limited course, where the core focus is on their own learning.Downloaded from http://bjsw.oxfordjournals.org/ at Bolland Library, UWE Bristol on January 20, 2014;Connor, Leonard - 2013 - Decision Making in Children and Families Social Work The Practitioner ’ s Voice.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=1871 end=2682 startpage=7 endpage=7;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Develop- ment of learning and expertise was contrasted with pre-course experience and confidence:Now . . . having a theoretical framework . . . I feel quite confident of what I am recommending (Student Practitioner (undergraduate) FG1).For qualified practitioners, discussion centred on immediate decisions in- volving risk, child protection and longer-term work with children and their families where complex decisions needed to be made and reviewed, involv- ing capacity for the parent to change. Their own professional identity, the development of their role and learning from experience were central. Par- ticipants noted discrepancies between the length of time spent with children and families, the evidence provided from this and the weight given to the views and decisions of other professionals who may see a family once or twice. This was pertinent to court processes for care proceedings where time is a crucial factor. The passing of time interfaced with ‘voice’ and the strength of the social work voice in interprofessional contexts.Qualified practitioners perceived that their skills in complex communica- tion and assessment had developed since qualification and were more able to encourage service users to tell their story:I think you get better with questions, don’t you? . . . In terms of analysis you know to cut through to the chase and get that information to base your deci- sions on.and in response:You get better at reading people as well (Qualified Practitioners FG4).Qualified practitioners identified the importance of the perspective of children and their need for stability and security in ensuring suitable time- scales for parents to demonstrate ability and motivation to change. Two examples illustrate the complexities of the decision-making process and the significance of time to review evidence in order to avoid falling into heuristic patterns of risk assessment and decision making which lack in-depth analysis and reasoning:;Connor, Leonard - 2013 - Decision Making in Children and Families Social Work The Practitioner ’ s Voice.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=66 end=2748 startpage=8 endpage=8;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

But often we don’t see the outcome. You start the case, you make a decision and then it’s moved on to another team (Qualified Practitioner FG4).. . . measuring the consequences of that decision . . . I know my decision will signify the rest of this young person’s life (Student Practitioner (under- graduate) FG1).Strength of voiceWho has a voice? Which voices are listened to or acted upon, when and how? The power of individual and diverse voices involved in the social work process emerged as distinct themes across all focus groups. Qualified practitioners identified other professionals, organisations and their own managers as having powerful voices that were listened to and viewed more favourably and in preference to their own voice. Legal and medical professionals were unanimously identified as having greater power and status. Qualified practitioners’ dialogue at times mirrored the lack of voice and sense of powerlessness they identified in some service users’ experience:When it comes to the level of managers in three different services, health, education and social care, and it’s out of control and you’re at the mercy, just like the families, what do you do? (Qualified Practitioner FG4)Both qualified and student practitioners focused on strategies they used in order to be recognised, such as involving senior managers (qualified prac- titioners) and repeatedly contacting other professionals until they carried out the task required (student practitioner).

Specifically, each table shows the effect of selected variables on the relative odds of one form of placement preference over the comparison preference of foster family or kinship care. For example, Table 1 shows the effect of selected child and family characteristics, as perceived by social workers, on the estimated relative odds that a social worker would prefer group care for a child as opposed to a foster or kinship home. The table shows the log-odds parameter estimates (Beta), the standard errors of the estimates, and the probability that the esti- mated values vary from zero by chance alone. The last column in the table converts the log-odds parameters into terms representing the estimated multi- plicative impact of each variable on the estimated relative odds of the pre- ferred placement being in group care as opposed to foster family/kinship care. A value greater than one indicates a greater estimated likelihood of a prefer- ence for group care over foster family/kinship care whereas a value less than;Courtney - 1998 - Correlates of social worker decisions to seek treatment-oriented out-of-home care.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=1511 end=2666 startpage=12 endpage=12;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

To this end, a 2 x 2 x 4 MANOVA (2 groups x 2 times x 4 fields) was per- formed. Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the chil- dren’s quality of life in all four fields for the four groups, at the time of decision and as predicted if the child remains at home.The analysis yielded a significant difference between the two groups of children (F(1.160)=167,29; ~~001). Overall, the quality of life at the tune of the decision of the children kept at home was higher than that of the children who were removed (M=3.81; SD=.66 versus M=2.87; SD=.71).";Davidson-Arad - 2001 - Predicted Changes in Children's Quality of Life in Decisions Regarding the Removal of Children at Risk from their.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=867 end=1727 startpage=5 endpage=5;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

In addition, a three way interaction was found between the group, time, and field (F(3,480)=8.83; p<.OOl). Since this interaction includes all the two way interactions, it is sufficient to explain the three way interaction alone. To this end, post hoc Sheffe tests comparing the quality of life at the two times in each field in each of the two groups of children were performed. The tests yielded the following findings: Among the children who were kept at home, there were significant differences between their quality of life at the time of the decision and their predicted quality of life if they re- mained at home in the psychological, social, and cultural fields.

The MANOVA examined (1) whether the parents of the children kept at home differed in cooperativeness from the parents of the children who were re- moved, and (2) whether the mothers and fathers differed in their coopera- tiveness. Results showed a sighificant difference between the parents of the two groups of children (F(1,118)=17.71; ~~01). As can be seen from Table 4, the parents whose children were kept at home were more coopera- tive than those whose children were removed from home.1. for this analysis, only the responses of child protection officers who had full data on two children -one who was kept at home and another who was re- moved (n=162) were used. The children whom data was provided (n=324) were then treated as subjects.A significant difference was also found between the mothers and fa- thers (F(1,118)=7.23; ~-01). The cooperation of the mothers in both groups was greater than that of the fathers. No significant interaction was found between the difference in gender of the parent and the decision. That is, in both groups, the difference between the mothers’ and fathers’ coop- eration was similar. *";Davidson-Arad - 2001 - Predicted Changes in Children's Quality of Life in Decisions Regarding the Removal of Children at Risk from their.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=298 end=1783 startpage=9 endpage=9;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018
13:133;These findings show an association between the workers’ decisions and the assessment of the child’s…;"These findings show an association between the workers’ decisions and the assessment of the child’s quality of life at home not only at the time of the decision but also in the future. These findings are consistent with various findings showing that the primary factor in the decisions of child protection officers is their prediction of the degree of risk that the child would face by remaining at home (Shapira & Benbenisty, 1993; Meddin, 1984).The fields most closely linked to the decision were the psychological and social. Among both groups of children, these are the fields where there were the largest disparities between the assessment of the quality of life at the time of the decision and the predicted quality of life at home. More- over, these fields best explained the child protection officers’ decisions.Two main reasons can be suggested for this emphasis. One is that most children who are referred to child protection agencies are not at risk of physical injury (Dolev & Rivkin, 1996; Mandel, Lehman & Yuille, 1994; Wells & Tracy, 1996). Indeed, in both groups, the children’s physical qual- ity of life was higher than that in the other three fields at both points of time.The other reason is that the literature on children at risk focuses on the psychological and social damage of their neglect or abuse. In the psycho- logical domain, repeated mention is made of narcissistic injuries to the children’s self-image, self-esteem, and self-confidence; and of the risk of depression, apathy, guilt, aggression, and defensiveness. In the social do- main, the difficulties of trusting others, of forming interpersonal relations both with their age mates and adults, and of assuming social roles have been noted (Bowlby, 1977; Dolev & Rivkin, 1996; Gizynsky, 1985; Green, 1978; Kinard, 1980; Rosenthal, 1988).The question arises as to why the cultural field - variables such as cul- tural activity, value adjustment, honesty, and having stable values - con- tributes less to the explanation of the child protection offricers’decisions. One wonders whether child protection workers believe that this area of life is less critical to children’s development.The findings also show that the cooperation of the parents was associ- ated both with the child protection officers’ assessments of the children’s quality of life at the two times and with their decisions. The quality of life of the children of the more cooperative parents was rated higher at the time of the decision and more likely to improve in the future than that of the children whose parents were deemed less cooperative.

They are also consistent with Alter’s (1985) finding that in cases where the child shows no clear physical injury, social workers use abstract variables such as the parents’ motivation to change in deciding whether or not the child has been neglected. In light of Alter’s finding, it may be suggested that the role of parental cooperativeness in this study is related to the fact that most of the children in the studywere not in physical danger.The association between parental cooperativeness and the workers’ de- cisions may be explained by the possibility that the workers view coopera- tive parents as more likely than uncooperative parents to make good use of the help offered them to improve -their parenting. This explanation is sup- ported by the differential patterns of association between the parents’ co- operativeness and the assessment of the children’s quality of life. Among the children who were kept at home, both the mother’s and father’s co- operativeness was associated with the children’s predicted quality of life. Among the children who were removed from home, the association was mainly with the quality of life at the time of the decision and mainly with the mother’s cooperativeness. That is, it seems that the child protection workers linked the cooperation of both parents of the children they decided to leave at home to expected improvements in the child’s quality of life. It may be that they assume that the parents’ cooperation with the help they are offered will bring about a higher quality of life for their children. This assumption is worth further study, as is the entire issue of the attributions that child protection workers make to parents.The main limitation of the study is its retrospective design. This design was used in order to examine the real decisions of virtually all the child protection officers in Israel. As a result, however, the possibility that the respondents provided retrospective justification for their decisions cannot be ruled out. At the same time, the findings do suggest that in making their decisions, child protection officers consider not only the child’s quality of life at the time of the decision but also the child’s future quality of life at home, It should be noted, however, that the questionnaire was answered anonymously about children who were equally anonymous to the re- searcher, so the workers had no need for defensive post-facto ratings. At the very least, the findings point to the things that the child protection offi- cers believe should guide their decisions. To clarify this issue, the author";Davidson-Arad - 2001 - Predicted Changes in Children's Quality of Life in Decisions Regarding the Removal of Children at Risk from their.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=18 end=2828 startpage=13 endpage=13;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Moreover, the findings suggest that child protection officers can use their assessments of the child’s quality of life at the time of the decision and of the expected quality of life at home in the future to distinguish between children they can keep at home in the expectation that their well being will improve and children that they have to remove from home because of the expectation that their already poor quality of life at home is likely to be- come even worse. It may be worth investigating the possibility of using the quality of life questionnaire as a risk assessment instrument.;Davidson-Arad - 2001 - Predicted Changes in Children's Quality of Life in Decisions Regarding the Removal of Children at Risk from their.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=44 end=948 startpage=14 endpage=14;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

As with the children (see Table 1), parents for whose children the decision was implemented were significantly more cooperative than those for whose children the decision was not implemented (p < .01).Social workers’ features: To examine whether the implementation of the decision was related to features of the social worker, we examined the education, position, and years of experience of the workers in the two groups. A significant difference was found only in their years of experience (t = 2.33; df = 39; p < .05). The workers who implemented their initial decisions on removal had fewer years of experience (M = 4.04; SD = 2.25) than those who did not (M = 5.72; SD = 2.35).A discriminant function analysis was carried out to determine the total contribution of the above variables to the distinction between the children for whom the decision to remove was implemented (N = 21, information was missing for three children) and those for whom it was not (N = 16, information was missing for two children). The results yielded a significant discriminant function (χ2 = 23.52; df = 1; p < .001). The only significant contribution was the child’s cooperation with the social worker. This variable correctly classifies 91.2% of the children for whom the decision to remove was implemented and 75% of the children for whom the decision to remove was not implemented.";Davidson-Arad et al. - 2003 - Why social workers do not implement decisions to remove children at risk from home.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=468 end=1903 startpage=5 endpage=5;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

The scale related to Community Services, though composed of only three items, also had good reliability ( ̨ = .87). Of the two components of the Removal Decisions section, component 1 had the better reliability ( ̨ = .76), which is good, compared to component 2 ( ̨ = .66), which is acceptable. Reliability of the Difficult Situations scale also was acceptable ( ̨ = .65). Reliability of the Disposition scale was too low ( ̨ = .33) to be useful. Of the two Liability subscales, Support had good reliability ( ̨ = .72), but reliability of the Worry scale was poor ( ̨ = .55), but may be useful for some purposes. Reliability of these two Liability subscales, though, as well as that of Difficult Situations, probably could be improved considerably in future research by the addition of more items, as these are only three to four item scales. The Disposition scale also is brief (3 items) but the reliability of it is so low that future work should, we suggest, include a fundamental reconsideration of the construct and how to measure it. The scale descriptive results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that the scale frequency distributions vary widely in form, most having distinctly non-normal character (as is seen in particular with reference to the skew and kurtosis statistics).Principal Components Analysis of Removal DecisionsAs indicated above, the PC analysis resulted in the extraction of two components from the Removal Decisions section, as shown in the pattern matrix of Table 3. These components were later characterized as an External Reference and Internal Reference to decision-making. Consideration of how these components were characterized is deferred until Discussion, but the content of each item is included in Table 3. It should be noted that the items within each component are sorted in descending order, so that the top items are most representative of the content of the scale as a whole. The PC-defined and the exclusively sorted/unit weighted versions of these scales both are highly correlated (  = .98), suggesting that the much simpler unit-weighted versions can be used for most purposes without a substantial loss of information. The scales themselves are significantly but only moderately correlated (  = .21 between the PC versions, and   = .35 between the unit- weighted versions).;Dettlaff et al. - 2015 - Development of an instrument to understand the child protective services decision-making process, with a focus.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=1184 end=4245 startpage=5 endpage=5;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

However, novices did not appear to have a compre- hensive understanding of each theory or to really understand how to apply the theory to practice. They often used theories 'after the fact' as a way of explaining why they had taken a particular course of action, rather than using theory consciously and deliberately at the time. They were also often ambi- valent about how useful social work theories were to practice and some cau- tioned against too heavy a reliance on any one theory as they considered that it was important to view each situation as individual and unique and not to allow theory to govern one's view of the world. Novices therefore frequently described their use of theory as unconscious rather than conscious.Probably crisis intervention model. I don't know if that's a social work theory but I would say that's probably what I used in this case, but not consciously. So I didn't take it into account when I was formulating my decision. And maybe I'd use a bit of family therapy too, but that wouldn't establish itself until later. At the moment it's just finding out if there's a big problem and fixing it up quickly, so that's crisis intervention . . . I haven't got enough experience in social work models and theories yet to know how appropriate or what level of knowledge you would need to have to be the best you could be (Subject 002).;Drury-Hudson - 1999 - Decision making in Child Protection The Use of Theoretical, Empirical and Procedural Knowledge by Novices and Expe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=1176 end=2738 startpage=4 endpage=4;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Novices had generally read very little of the research in the area of child protection and therefore did not use this informa- tion when considering whether the children should be removed from home. Furthermore, novices reported that research articles were often difficult to understand and they often felt that research was too far removed from prac- tice. Novices particularly disliked research articles that reported detailed stat- istical tests and results.I don't know of any research I could draw on to support my decision. None whatsoever... . There are some articles that are really psychology based and that have lots of empirical theories and that sort of stuff and I find them a bit hard to read. I tend to just read the discussion because the stats don't mean that much to me. So if they're really psychology based then I don't like reading them (004).No I don't know of any research that I could draw on to make my decision so I'm not able to comment... . They [research articles] would help me slightly but I wouldn't rely on them because this is this situation and each situation is different .... They might be of some use but not a high use (008).While novices were often not aware of the research literature, experts were more aware of the research literature in relation to child maltreatment and did attempt to consciously employ this knowledge in their decision making.Yes they [research articles] are useful. A good example of this is that if you've got an injured baby and there is no one accepting responsibility for the injuries, and the medical diagnosis and opinion are that it is physical assault, and the family are saying that this is an accident, I think the research literature suggests that this is a dangerous situation if no one is accepting responsibility (010).An example of the type of research that I've read is the importance of children main- taining contact with their own families once they're in care. I've read about how neglect can be one of the most serious forms of abuse in terms of an hierarchy of abuse.... I know about the vulnerability of children of neglectful parents. Yes I think I did take it into account when making my decision and I think it was conscious (015).Table 2 summarizes the comments made in relation to empirical knowledge.;Drury-Hudson - 1999 - Decision making in Child Protection The Use of Theoretical, Empirical and Procedural Knowledge by Novices and Expe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=40 end=2371 startpage=8 endpage=8;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018
18:250;Probably my assessment of the risk factors was one of the main factors which influ- enced my decisio…;Probably my assessment of the risk factors was one of the main factors which influ- enced my decision (001).I'd say the assessment of the risk factors involved was probably my main priority (002).However, eight of the ten novices assessed the neglect to the children as being relatively minor, or not as serious as sexual or physical abuse.I think that [risk] was very important in my decision. I'd suppose I'd made judgements about the resources for the mother, or the lack of these. And I've also made judge- ments about if they were there, the mother may be motivated to look after the kids. So I suppose that had a big bearing on not removing the children and the lack of seriousness in the sense that they weren't being left out in the cold all night (009). This is a problem of neglect... I'm not saying that it's not significant but the immedi- ate safety of the children is not jeopardised (007).I am not quite sure [if I would remove the children]. I guess the children are suffering more from neglect than anything . . . . The mother's not physically hurting them. It's more of a neglect situation (004).Statements such as this can be contrasted with those made by the experts in the study. The expert social workers were more likely to have a clearer understanding and knowledge of risk assessment and those factors most important in determining risk to the child. They were also more able to weigh up the risks to the children in the case study which led them to conclude that the situation was relatively serious.Yes, I identified lots of risk factors. The children's health problems, the diagnosis of pneumonia, the older children doing the parenting of the younger children, the mother being withdrawn, the older one seeming to choose not to go home after school, the mother's isolation, the fact that the mother doesn't seem to be a very powerful person, she's ended up without too many resources... . That, together with the children's presentation. What's most worrying is that she's not attending to quite a severe health problem, not thinking about what the children need. These risk factors were very important in influencing my decision. It makes it more urgent. It makes it easier to know that there is something that needs to be insisted on. (014)PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE—LEGISLATIONGenerally, novices reported that they knew very little about the legislation, apart from the basic philosophy underpinning the legislation, and 80 per cent stated that they knew very little about the evidence requirements for court. Therefore, novices did not take the legislation or the evidence requirements for court into account when making their decision. This was largely due to the fact that they felt that they did not have sufficient experience with court;Drury-Hudson - 1999 - Decision making in Child Protection The Use of Theoretical, Empirical and Procedural Knowledge by Novices and Expe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=23 end=2798 startpage=11 endpage=11;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

This is highlighted in the following comments.When you arc reading stuff about the legislation and people writing articles on that, it goes straight over your head because it's boring and you're not taking it in anyway (001).Legislation is often not user friendly and needs to have a handbook on how to interpret it (002).The legislative context defines the terms and conditions under which a child is considered to be in need of care and protection and outlines the authority under which child protection workers operate. It is therefore difficult to see how any reasonable decision can be arrived at without an understanding of the legislative framework. It is concerning that the majority of students enter child protection placements with very little understanding of the legal context they are operating within and they are only too happy to rely on co-workers to supply them with the information they need. This presupposes that all practising child protection workers possess a good understanding of the legis- lative framework, which is often not the case. Furthermore, it places students in a vulnerable and dependent role throughout the course of their placement, which does little to foster professional self-reliance and competence.This is a situation which should be remedied. Students need to be provided with at least a rudimentary understanding of the Children's Protection Act under which they work, prior to undertaking a placement in this area.While novices did not generally know a great deal about the legislation or the evidence requirements for court, the majority of them (80 per cent) stated that they felt that it was really important for people working in the area of child protection to have a good knowledge of the legislation:Well you need to very clearly know your limits from a legal point of view. You need to be very clear about what you can do and what you cannot do especially when you are considering removing children (003).In comparison, experts were much more aware of the principles, philosophy, investigative orders and powers that were a feature of the legislation and all (100 per cent) stated that they were very familiar with the evidence require- ments for court. Many experts spoke of having to give evidence in court or of writing reports for court.I know a lot about the evidence requirements because we see probably the most seriously injured children and so a lot of the children who I am involved with do end up in court cases. And it's not just the Youth Court but the Family Court and the Criminal Court as well. I spend a lot of time writing court reports and giving evidence in court (010).I think the evidence for court needs to be detailed and it needs to indicate quite clearly that the children's needs aren't being met and that the children's needs are unlikely to be met either (015).;Drury-Hudson - 1999 - Decision making in Child Protection The Use of Theoretical, Empirical and Procedural Knowledge by Novices and Expe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=40 end=2957 startpage=12 endpage=12;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

That wouldn't have had much impact on my decision as it doesn't seem to me that we are at that point. We are not trying to prove a crime . . . we are not trying to get anyone to make a statement. You're miles away from a situation where you are seeking long-term guardianship and you're probably not even seeking a short-term order (012).I would say that I'm very up to date with the evidence requirements for court and, yes, it did have an impact on my decision because I knew that I would have to put up a very strong case to the court to get the children removed. However, it wouldn't mean to say that I wouldn't take that decision (017).PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE—ORGANIZA TIONAL POLICY AND PROCEDURESA tension frequently exists between professional autonomy and the environ- ment within which practice takes place. Research on professionals in organ- izations indicates discrepancies between professional and organizational expectations and goals (Dworkin, 1990). These goals are developed within the context of community expectations and organizational policy. Therefore, what in the professional's view may be in the best interests of the child is not the only factor influencing child protection decision making as workers are also bound by organizational policies and procedures. It is therefore important for child protection workers to have a good understanding of these forms of knowledge.Novices often felt very unclear about the definitions and differences between policy and procedures and often confused these with legislation. They also often found policies and procedures difficult to understand and were very reliant on their supervisor to inform them of any which existed and how these should be taken into account The following excerpts are fairly typical statements made by novices in relation to policies and procedures:I am not quite sure of the differences between policy and procedure (005).I didn't take them into account when I was forming my decision. I did take into account the practice papers on risk assessment but there would obviously be some other practice papers I could draw upon. But mostly the procedure would be known and is fairly well used in FACS [Family and Community Services]. But just the practice papers on risk assessment. It is conscious in that it's very present at the moment. It is conscious (006).I suppose I would draw on child protection policy if it is a policy. I'm not sure what;Drury-Hudson - 1999 - Decision making in Child Protection The Use of Theoretical, Empirical and Procedural Knowledge by Novices and Expe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=23 end=2876 startpage=13 endpage=13;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Ove…;"Sample Demographic CharacteristicsThe sample’s descriptive information is presented in Table 1. Over half of the sample (58.7%) was African American and one in four (25.6%) were White. The sample was evenly split between males (49.6%) and females (50.4%).Prevalence of Placement in Foster CareRoughly one in ten children (105 total) were placed into foster care during the follow-up period. The mean age of placement was slightly more than eight years old. Of those children who were placed, 29.5% (n = 31) were first placed at age 4 or 5, 27.6% (n=29) at age 6 or 7, 22.9% (n=24) at ages 8–11, 15.2% (n=16) at ages 12–15, and 4.8% (n=5) at age 16 or 17.Bivariate Within-Domain Multivariate Predictors of Foster Care EntryThe bivariate and within-domain predictors of entry into foster care are presented in the first two columns of Table 2. Among the child characteristics, there were no significant bivariate effects of demographic characteristics, behavioral prob- lems, or low birth weight/prematurity. Only Battelle Developmental Screening Test scores predicted foster care entry, with lower scores predicting higher risk of foster entry. Within-domain multivariate analyses produced similar findings (only lower Battelle scores predicted foster care entry). Although African American children were significantly less likely than white children to enter foster care, there was no significant overall effect of race/ethnicity.Among caregiver characteristics, there were no significant bivariate or multivariate effects of physical health, adult history of victimization, or parenting attitudes. There were significant bivariate effects of both childhood physical victimization and childhood sexual victimization, although these were no longer significant in within-domain multivariate analyses. Significant bivariate effects of both alcohol use and depression symptoms persisted in within-domain multivariate analyses; caregivers with more alcohol use and with more depressive symptoms were more likely to have their children enter foster care.Among the family microsystem variables examined, none predicted entry into foster care in the bivariate analyses. The same was true of the multivariate analyses within the family microsystem class of variables. This could be due in part to the relatively small sample size.Among the macrosystem variables examined, there was no significant effect of neighborhood satisfaction. However, both low social support and caregiver’s receipt of mental health services predicted foster care entry. Both of these variables remained significant in the multivariate analysis within macrosystem.Finally, children’s early maltreatment experiences were examined. In bivariate analyses, children who had past reports of neglect, physical abuse, and emotional maltreatment were at elevated risk for entry into foster care. In addition, more severe experiences of maltreatment were associated with risk for entry into foster care, as were number of reports. There was no significant effect of early reports of sexual abuse. In the multivariate analysis within early maltreatment, only emotional maltreatment and number of early CPS reports significantly predicted entry into foster care.Omnibus Multivariate Predictors of Entry into Foster CareAll of the variables that were significant in the domain multivariate analyses were entered into an omnibus Cox survival regression: child Battelle Developmental Screening Test, caregiver alcohol use, caregiver depressive symptoms, caregiver mental health care, early emotional maltreatment, and number of early reports of maltreatment. This analysis is presented in";English, Thompson, White - 2015 - Predicting risk of entry into foster care from early childhood experiences A survival analysis using L.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=1557 end=5208 startpage=4 endpage=4;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018
21:331;The effects of heuristics on the subjective risk assessment We hypothesised that the objective level…;"The effects of heuristics on the subjective risk assessmentWe hypothesised that the objective level of risk would significantly influence the risk level evaluated by the respondents (subjective risk assessment). Indeed, the highest average of subjective risk assessment was for the high-risk group (M1 1⁄4 3.95; SD1 1⁄4 0.98), followed by the averages of the ambiguous- risk cases (M2 1⁄4 2.75; SD2 1⁄4 1.13), and finally the no-risk cases (M3 1⁄4 0.54; SD3 1⁄4 0.639). The differences between each pair of averages were significant (high-risk–ambiguous-risk: t 1⁄4 13.18, p , 0.001; ambiguous-risk–no-risk: t 1⁄4 26.36, p , 0.001).Furthermore, in comparing the assessment variances for each risk level, we found the highest for ambiguous risk, followed in descending degree of vari- ance by high-risk and no-risk. Levine’s test of difference between variances indicates that the differences are significant: ambiguous-risk–high-risk, F(422, 210) 1⁄4 1.34, p , 0.01; ambiguous-risk–no-risk, F(422, 211) 1⁄4 3.13, p , 0.001; high-risk – no-risk, F(210, 211) 1⁄4 2.34, p , 0.001. These findings imply that, particularly in the ambiguous cases, other factors such as heuristic thinking may influence the social workers’ professional judgement.To estimate the effects of heuristics (the child’s SES and ethnic origin) on the respondents’ subjective risk assessment, which we controlled for inter- vening effects of professional and personal characteristics, we conducted multiple regression models with subjective risk assessment as the dependent variable; three regression models were estimated, one for each level of ob- jective risk. The results presented in Table 1 indicate that being poor is per- ceived as a serious risk factor for children, even in no-risk cases, and the effect increases as the level of objective risk increases. Ethnicity was a signifi- cant factor only in cases of ambiguous risk, when social workers are faced with uncertainty.The effects of heuristics on social workers’ recommendations for out-of-home placementsNo out-of-home placement recommendations were made for the no-risk cases; 12 per cent of the ambiguous-risk cases and, interestingly, 56 per cent of the high-risk cases were recommended for out-of-home placement. The differences between the three risk levels were significant (x2(2) 1⁄4 245.62; p , 0.001). As hypothesised, we found that as the objective level of risk to the child increases, out-of-home placement is more likely to be recom- mended. We then hypothesised that the respondents’ heuristics influenced";Enosh, Bayer-Topilsky - 2015 - Reasoning and bias Heuristics in safety assessment and placement decisions for children at risk.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=255 end=2814 startpage=7 endpage=7;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

To test this hy- pothesis, we performed a chi-square test for each heuristic (SES and ethnic origin) at the high-risk and ambiguous-risk levels.Since none of the low-risk cases was recommended for out-of-home place- ment, there was no need for further analysis at this level. The findings sum- marised in Table 2 show that the recommendations for out-of-home placements in ambiguous-risk cases are significantly higher in low-SES cases compared with moderate-high-SES cases (20.4 per cent versus 3.3 per cent; p , 0.001, respectively) and for children of Mizrahi ethnic origin com- pared with those of Ashkenazy ethnic origin (15.1 per cent versus 8.5 per cent, p , 0.05, respectively). However, to our surprise, we found that the social workers also recommended more out-of-home placements for high-risk, low-SES cases compared with high-risk, moderate-high-SES cases (86.67 per cent versus 26.42 per cent, p , 0.001, respectively). The findings also revealed a trend for more out-of-home placement recommendations for Mizrahi children at high risk compared with Ashkenazy children at high risk (53.4 per cent versus 59.3 per cent, respectively). This difference was not statistically significant.To examine the effects of biases on the likelihood to recommend an out-of-home placement, we conducted a logistic regression analysis for each of the two objective risk levels—ambiguous and high. These results are presented in Table 3.Table 3 demonstrates that, for ambiguous-risk levels, the child’s SES and ethnic origin predict the social worker’s recommendation for an out-of-home placement: children from low-SES families at ambiguous risk are about 2.5 times more likely to be removed than children who are at the same risk level but from moderate-high-SES families.

However, the findings demonstrate that, in high-risk cases, SES appears as a strong predictor of the social worker’s likeliness to recommend out-of-home placement: low-SES families are 6.3 times more likely to be removed from their home than children at high risk from moderate-high-SES families. This surprising finding suggests that low SES is perceived by social workers as a risk factor and contradicts the hypothesis that, in cases of unam- biguous risk (no-risk/high-risk), SES will have low or no effect on the social worker’s decision making.;Enosh, Bayer-Topilsky - 2015 - Reasoning and bias Heuristics in safety assessment and placement decisions for children at risk.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=834 startpage=10 endpage=10;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

A description of the sample by substantiation and removal can be found in Table 1. Compared with unsubstantiated cases, substantiated cases came from agencies with longer timelines for completing investigations and higher service availability. Substantiated cases were also more likely to come from agencies that lacked a system of care in the area, that were operating under a consent decree and used more standardized assessment tools. On the county level, substantiated cases were more likely than unsubstantiated cases to be from communities with more black residents. Substantiated cases were also more likely to have been investi- gated by caseworkers with an advanced degree and more years of experience. On the family and child level, all risk factors except CPS history and economic problems were more common in substantiated cases than in unsubstantiated cases. Child demographics did not differ by substantiation status.Substantiated cases resulting in removal were more likely to come from agencies allowing 30 or fewer days to complete an investigation and 3 or more days between removal and initial hearing. They were also more likely to come from agencies that lost funding and used a structural decision making model. Removal cases were marginally less likely to have been investigated by a caseworker with a social work degree or an advanced degree. The only family risk factor positively associated with removal was caregiver mental health and substance abuse problems. Additionally, removal cases were more likely than non-removal cases to involve black children or younger children, and less likely to involve non-Hispanic children of a race other than white or black.HLM ResultsResults of our HLM estimates predicting substantiation are found in Table 2. We find no statistically significant asso- ciations between time factors and substantiation. However, for service availability, we find that two factors, collaboration and ability to provide services for unsubstantiated cases, are associated with a significantly lower probability of substan- tiation, even after controlling for county, family and child characteristics. These factors predict a 16 (collaboration) and 20 (services for unsubstantiated cases) percentage point (PP) lower probability of substantiation. For decision-making fac- tors, we find that use of a structural decision-making model predicts a large decrease in the probability of substantiation,;Font, Maguire-Jack - 2015 - Reprint of Decision-making in child protective services Influences at multiple levels of the social ecology.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=3030 end=5590 startpage=5 endpage=5;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

Realizes that SDM is not the knowledge. (9)As expected, the inexperienced practitioners reflected Fook et al.’s (2000) finding that ‘novices’ are more likely to follow rules to guide their decision- making. They tended to use analytical reasoning with reference to sources external to them, such as the SDM tools and the Practice Manual.LESS EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS (1–5 YEARS)Within this group of participants (14 of the total), there were those who, despite their growing experi- ence, expressed their dependency on the tools:Could not imagine what would happen if there was no more SDM tomorrow, does rely on it to guide her practice. (29)But also that their dependency would reduce with time:Could see that, as her experience grows, she would outgrow SDM and not be so reliant on it.Then she might be less likely to use it. (29)For others, their use of the tools was not contingent on the passing of time:Experience is not a factor as there is only one right way to interpret the definitions and use the tools. The definitions are very clear. (33)Participants in this group not only discussed how they used the tools at the time of the interview, but also reflected on how they had used them when they had started work with the Department:It provides really good guidance to people who are new to the Department and child protection, particularly about what constitutes risk. (28)She started in the job when SDM was being rolled out. She thought it was brilliant because she had no practice framework. (33)She loved it (SDM) when it first came in because it gave her a sense of order, told her what to do. Feels there should be more emphasis on training about the tools and compliance with them. She gets confused by the way that people choose to take notice of the tools or not. (42)There was also concern expressed about the efficacy of the tools for inexperienced practitioners:Newer workers also don’t use it (SDM) as a guide to profes- sional judgment – they take it literally. (21)The tools were also considered to be educative:She does not need Structured Decision Making but thinks it is good for inexperienced workers – good for provoking discus- sion and can be used as a learning tool to help develop knowl- edge. (16)Participants also spoke positively about the debates that the SDM tools had stimulated when they were introduced in the department as practitioners, team leaders and managers started to use them and engage with the definitions of abuse and neglect they contain. It was lamented that these debates had gradually sub- sided over the months as some form of consensus was reached within teams and Child Safety Service Centres (CSSC). However, consensus did not mean that there was overall consistency in how the tools were interpreted or used, as this differed from one team to another and one CSSC to another (Gilling- ham & Humphreys 2010).Within the Department, more experienced practi- tioners, team leaders, senior practitioners and manag- ers talked about the need to develop a ‘professional framework’ or ‘practice framework’. This was consid- ered important because, as evidenced in the sample of participants for this research, most of the practitioners were not qualified social workers and had little or no experience of work in the human services sector before joining the department. While the attitudes of unqualified participants towards social workers ranged from hostile to ambivalent, one participant who was not a qualified social worker provided the following observation:Has noticed at training that there is a big difference between people who have done social work and those with psych degrees – the social workers already had a practice framework whereas she herself had no idea when she started. (33)Within this group of participants, there was evi- dence to suggest that reliance on the tools as the main source of knowledge and guidance had started to diminish with time. However, this finding needs to be considered in the context of the main findings of the research. While some participants may have articu- lated a reliance on the tools, at least initially, there were many participants within this group who described how they could and did manipulate the tools to get the responses they wanted, having already made a decision. As stated previously, there was little evidence that the tools were used to assist decision- making (Gillingham 2009a).;Gillingham - 2011 - Decision-making tools and the development of expertise in child protection practitioners are we ‘just breeding w.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=49 end=4634 startpage=4 endpage=4;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;11/10/2018

More specific questions were also asked as the research pro- ceeded, in order to explore themes that emerged from previous interviews and the observations of practitioners using the tools. The interviews also allowed space to ask questions about what had been observed during, for example, visits to families, team and office meetings and attendance, when it would not have been appropriate for the researcher to interject. The fol- lowing themes emerged from the data that relate to the main aims of the SDM tools, namely to assist decision making, promote consistency in decision making and target the children most in need. Quotes are presented that represent a dominant response by participants to a particular theme in the data. The statements made by participants are sometimes presented in the third person, as they were recorded by the researcher in the Field Diary.To assist decision makingThe main decisions that were being made by participants in this research were about which referrals to accept for investigation, the urgency of an investigation, whether a child was safe in the short term with their parent/care-giver and which cases should be opened after investigation for further involvement. Early in the fieldwork, it became clear that decisions were being made some time before the SDM tools were com- pleted in the electronic case recording system:Already made their decisions before they use the tools (Interview 7). Tend to have made up their minds before they use the tools (Interview 41).;Gillingham, Humphreys - 2010 - Child Protection Practitioners and Decision-Making Tools Observations and Reflections from the Front Line.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=904 end=2631 startpage=6 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

Fine point about whether their thinking is affected by the tools anyway—but in serious cases then common sense takes over anyway (Interview 13).Indeed, participants reported how they manipulated the tools to achieve an outcome that agreed with the decision they had already made:Have to manipulate SDM tools to get what you want and get it to say what you want it to say (Interview 36).SDM can be manipulated to give you whatever outcome you want, especially the Safety tool. Just a matter of ticking or not ticking a particular box (Interview 32).The theme of manipulating the tools emerged from one of the first observa- tional experiences in the research. A practitioner was discussing with col- leagues how to get the result she wanted from the FRET and one of them explained how and then showed her (and the researcher) what to do.To promote consistencyConsistency in decision making and service delivery between practitioners, teams and Child Safety Service Centres was, generally, not considered to be important by the participants in this research and it became clear that the SDM tools had not improved consistency in terms of the process or out- comes of decision making:Huge differences between how different offices use the tools (Interview 32).Huge differences between service centres—some things go from one extreme to another—a P1 [notification requiring a response within 24 hours] from another centre might only be a CCR [Child Concern Report not requiring a response] if she accepts it in this office (Interview 34).One participant suggested the following reason for this lack of consistency:. . . because of people’s different experiences and knowledge because this impacts on how they interpret the definitions within SDM—particularly words like ‘cruel’ and ‘usual’ (Interview 34).Contextual factors also emerged strongly as a theme to explain inconsis- tency between Child Safety Service Centres (CSSC):. . . added that they were not busy that week—on a busy week that might have been a CCR (Child Concern Report, not requiring action) (Comment by participant, excerpt from Field Diary).Used to work in [another Child Safety Service Centre] where it was much busier and there she used the tools differently—there was no point in;Gillingham, Humphreys - 2010 - Child Protection Practitioners and Decision-Making Tools Observations and Reflections from the Front Line.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=62 end=2552 startpage=7 endpage=7;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

In particular, statements made by participants about use of the FRET, which is used to determine which cases should be opened for further inter- vention, support this conclusion.The FRET was not used at the time decisions about cases were made and had little part in the process of decision making:FRET done as an afterthought and has little influence on what they do with a case subsequently (Interview 42).FRET as another piece of paperwork (Interview 12).The time differences between decisions and actions being taken and sub- sequently recorded using the SDM tools emerged in the audit of the case files. This was confirmed by observations of practitioners conducting inves- tigative interviews with families and then returning to the office. Case files (and the SDM tools) were frequently not updated or completed for days, perhaps even weeks, until or unless there was some imperative to do so, for example, the need to close or transfer a case or the possibility of scrutiny of a case file by senior management.Despite the guidance provided by the Department’s Practice Manual, cases that had been assigned a ‘high-risk’ level were routinely closed, again because of limited resources:FRET is fairly useless as always gives high or very high—they do not auto- matically open very high cases as they do not have the staff to do so (Inter- view 24).In summary, the findings of this research were that the aims of the implementation of the SDM to assist decision making, promote consistency and target the children most in need of service provision had not been met. The focus of the research on how the tools were actually being used also provided useful insights about why these aims were not being met.Explaining the findings: practitioner perspectives and unintended consequencesDuring interviews, participants were keen to explain why they did not use the tools as intended by their designers. Their reasons can be summarised under two main themes in the data, which relate to the design of;Gillingham, Humphreys - 2010 - Child Protection Practitioners and Decision-Making Tools Observations and Reflections from the Front Line.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=43 end=2420 startpage=8 endpage=8;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

The main result of the analysis is presented in the structural equation diagram of Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the model is quite complex, and so we made certain accommodations to promote visual clarity. First, the measurement models and correlations are omitted from Fig. 2 and are instead presented in On-Line Tables 4a, 4b, 4c, 5 and On-Line Figures 4 and 5. The “L” in the scale names in Fig. 2 indicates the latent form of the variable, with reliability/measurement error already taken into account. Further, some of the exogenous variables (V57, V58, Male, Seniority, and PHisp) are shown in more than one place; it should be understood that conceptually these are singular, and ideally would be shown in just one place with all the associated arrows leading into and out of them – the reader is asked to make this combination mentally. Please note that residuals and R2 statistics (which correspond to the proportion of variance accounted for by the model) are given at the base of a short arrow leading into each endogenous variable (i.e., each variable that is “downstream” from any other variables in the model, and hence has some proportion of its variance explained by it).The model presented herein fits the observed data extremely well judging by the global fit statistics. The CFI and TLI (each ranging from 0 to 1) are both 0.99, the RMSEA is 0.018 (p < 0.05), and the SRMR is 0.027 (which is very low).

For each variable we describe what other variables in the model influence it, and indicate the extent to which the variable was explained (or not) in total by other variables in the model. It is our hope that our description of these variables and their interrelationships, even those not directly related to the placement decision, will promote a better understanding of the placement decision by explicating its context in terms of the DME domains and their mutual influences.Placement DecisionsWe found five factors that significantly influenced the percent of cases that resulted in removal of a child and placement into foster care, though together they explained only a modest proportion of the decision’s variance (R2 = 0.120). Case factors even as aggregated to the worker level were of most importance: Percent Removed was increased in part by greater average Risk being assessed (ˇ = 0.263) and more families on a worker’s caseload being Low Income (ˇ = 0.103). On the other hand, the placement percentage was decreased by higher proportions of Hispanic families on one’s caseload (ˇ = −0.099). Two Organizational factors were associated with lower percentages of removals: perceived organizational Support (ˇ = −0.131) and Workload/Resources being perceived as unmanageable (ˇ = −0.163). Another way to look at the negative coefficients is that placement rates were increased by lower proportions of Hispanic families on the caseload, as well as lower organizational support, and a perception of manageable workload and sufficient resources. Individual factors, i.e., variables characterizing the caseworkers, were not found to directly influence the placement decision, including workers’ own race/ethnicity.Case FactorsAmong case factors, only Risk Assessment was affected by other variables in the model, although it was not much explained by them (R2 = .053). Low Income (ˇ = 0.116) and the caseworker’s External Reference (ˇ = 0.093) influenced their risk assess- ments to be higher risk, whereas higher Case Skills (ˇ = −0.082) and a greater proportion of African American (ˇ = −0.193) or Hispanic (ˇ = −0.182) families on the worker’s caseload influenced their risk assessments to be lower risk.Organizational FactorsAmong Organizational factors, about a fifth of the variance (R2 = .209) of Support was explained by the model. It was promoted by a perception of availability of Services (ˇ = 0.305), and detracted from by Seniority (ˇ = −0.133), and by Workload being unmanageable (ˇ = −0.247). About 10% of the variance of Services was explained by the model (R2 = .107). Interpersonal Skills (ˇ = 0.239) and Disposition decision being based upon risk assessment (ˇ = 0.121) increased perception that services were sufficiently available, whereas Worry that CPS sometimes makes things worse for the child (ˇ = −0.155) and greater Seniority (ˇ = −0.099) detracted from it. Also 10% of the variance of perceived Workload and Resources was explained by the model (R2 = 0.102). Higher levels of Interpersonal Skills determined in part (ˇ = 0.173) a perception that workload was too high and/or that resources to adequately perform the job were insufficient.Caseworker FactorsThe construct most fully explained by the model was Worry about Liability (R2 = .447, which can be interpreted to indicate that nearly 45% of the latent construct’s variance was determined by other variables in the model). Worry about Liability was directly influenced by Difficult Situations (ˇ = 0.409) and indirectly by Support (ˇ = −0.376). By way of illustration of how to interpret negative paths such as this, this latter finding can mean that the greater a worker’s expectation of support by their supervisor if a child were to be harmed in one of the worker’s cases the less they tend to worry about the possible negative consequences to themselves that might happen due to such an event (e.g., getting disciplined or fired). Conversely, having less support causes more of this worry. The direct influence of Difficult Situations on Worry about Liability suggests that caseworkers who are uncomfortable working with hostile or difficult clients are more likely to be concerned about the personal consequences of their decisions. Workers also tended to be more worried about liability if they had more Seniority (ˇ = 0.149), greater Case Skills (ˇ = 0.171), and assessed their cases as being relatively risky (ˇ = 0.108). Higher levels on the Supervision and Work Unit factor (which reflects caseworkers’ perceptions of the quality of supervision they receive and support they receive from their coworkers) also were associated with more Worry about Liability (ˇ = 0.104).About 40% of the variance (R2 = .392) of the latent construct Difficult Situations was explained by the model, which is directly affected by an Internal Reference orientation (ˇ = 0.596), Workload and Resources being perceived as unmanageable (ˇ = 0.168), and Worry that CPS makes things worse for the child (ˇ = 0.125). On the other hand, Difficult Situations was lessened by the caseworker being male (ˇ = −0.155), by having more of an External Reference orientation (ˇ = −0.200), and by having a relatively high level of Case Skills (ˇ = −0.096).About a fifth of the variance (R2 = 0.202) of Internal Reference was explained by the model, specifically by Worry that CPS sometimes makes things worse for the child (ˇ = 0.408), and Professional collateral information is more reliable (ˇ = 0.085). Interpersonal Skills, however, negatively influenced Internal Reference (ˇ=−0.141).

Analysis of the data suggested that analytical decision-making methods were used for very specific reasons and in particular types of cases alongside experiential decision-making strategies, as demonstrated in the following example.Example 4: Evidence-based practice (Case 98)Here, a mother whose other children had been placed in the care of the local authority became pregnant. A case conference was held at which it was decided on the strength of historical information that the child should be placed in the care of the local authority at birth:I became involved in the case just after she was born and the decisions were already made because . . . historically her other siblings live [in care] . . .. So the decision was already made at the initial child protection conference that the baby would be removed at birth and placed with foster carers.Clearly, then, decision making was strongly influenced by prior experience of the family’s situation:Researcher: So the fact that this family was already known was quite an im- portant factor?Social worker: Very and plus you know all the other children don’t live with her.;Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results, Structure: Methodology;2;;start=660 end=2005 startpage=9 endpage=9;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
30:412;Experiential decision making All ninety-eight cases involved some element of experiential decision m…;Experiential decision makingAll ninety-eight cases involved some element of experiential decision making and, as in other naturalistic decision research, this revolved heavily around the use of prior case experience and intuition. This could be broken down further into seven main categories of experiential decision making as shown in Table 3 with their corresponding frequencies.Table 3 shows that the two most frequent types of experiential decision making used were: evidence of a family’s reaction to intervention and com- parison with known history, and prior experience of the family. A third cat- egory of decision making, featuring in two-fifths of cases, was comparison to other cases. These decision categories are important and warrant further explanation, particularly because simplifying decision making in this way could lead to systematic errors (Tversky and Kahneman, 1982). These errors could arise if workers fail to consider all the options that are available to them, assuming instead a fixed pattern of response born of prior experi- ence with the family or of other similar cases (Munro, 2002, p. 115). Indeed, such processes were identified in some of the cases, as highlighted in the fol- lowing three examples.Example 1: Using the family’s response to intervention as a guide to decision making (Case 38)A parent had made a number of requests for her children to be taken into the care of the local authority. The children were placed in the care of the local au- thority whilst further assessment could be undertaken. Throughout this process, the worker formed a positive view of the mother, largely based on the mother’s perceived commitment to addressing the underlying issues in her life, such as:Mother has engaged fully with the assessment process and accepts that she needs to address her unresolved issues in order for her to move forward.Mother recognises that she requires support with aspects of her parenting and has shown a willingness to work with children’s services and appears to be committed to making the necessary changes.On the basis of the mother’s engagement during the assessment, and in the absence of any consideration of other indicators, it was decided that the children’s names should be returned home. At this point, the mother refused to engage further with social services, who then had no remit under which to ensure that the mother did seek support.;Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=163 end=2579 startpage=6 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
30:414;However, the stakes were high, as the case was in the court arena and the risks to the child signifi…;"However, the stakes were high, as the case was in the court arena and the risks to the child significant. Additionally, some of the issues were unfamiliar to the social worker. This might account for the attempted use of evidence-based practice (EBP) in the assessment record, such as:Babies need stimulation in order for cognitive development to be success- fully reached. When mothers suffer depression the babies’ cognitive devel- opment may be affected because there is less interaction between mother and baby. Depressed mothers are known to respond less frequently to their babies’ cries.In interview, the social worker suggested that there was also a need to provide clear evidence via the core assessment for the decisions being made:It just reaffirmed that the decision was correct. So you know it gave you extra evidence you know just to reaffirm what decisions were made were correct because the baby would have been at immediate risk.Thus, analytical decision making was used alongside experiential decision making in such a way as to provide evidence for decisions already taken intuitively.The impact of case characteristics and environmental factors on decision makingThe data therefore suggested that social workers rely primarily on experi- ential methods of decision making rather than more formal analytical methods. The next step was to investigate the way in which case, individual and environmental factors influenced these processes. It was striking that:† familiarity with the case was a feature of 70.4 per cent of cases, whilst his- torical information was available in 61.2 per cent of cases;† certainty was a feature in 70.4 per cent of cases; and† in 51.3 per cent of cases, decision making was seen to be straightforward.An initial exploration of the influence of these characteristics suggested that these factors were associated with the use of more intuitive cognition relying on prior case work experience. As one social worker described:It wasn’t a difficult conclusion to reach. I didn’t agonise over it. I felt that it was an easy decision to make as for what was the best outcome. . . . It’s not the first time I’ve had to make a recommendation on these lines (Case 14).This poses one set of challenges for achieving the kind of analytical decision making typically seen as the ‘gold standard’. An exploration of the decision environment within which participants were working raised a further set of challenges. This exploration was based on considering the presence or absence of nine factors considered typical of naturalistic decision environ- ments (Orasanu and Connolly, 1993; Lipshitz, 1993). Table 5 shows that";Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=34 end=2702 startpage=10 endpage=10;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
30:415;elements of all of these nine factors (see Table 2 for explanations) were present in the cases under…;elements of all of these nine factors (see Table 2 for explanations) were present in the cases under examination.As can be seen in Table 5, the dynamic nature of the decision environ- ment was the prevalent complicating feature. Action/feedback loops (75.5 per cent), dynamic interplay (72 per cent) and uncertain dynamic environments (51 per cent) were the most frequently occurring factors to be found in the environment. This has implications for both decision making and the way in which analytical aids to decision making, such as the Assessment Framework, fit into this process, for two reasons.First, it shows that there was clearly interplay between the decision environment and the decision-making process. The process was therefore non-linear and social workers had to react and make decisions in the face of changing situations and changing levels of information so that decisions were never ‘discrete isolated events’ (Lipshitz, 1993, p. 133). As a result, in- formation was not always presented in a ‘neat, complete form’ (Orasanu and Connolly, 1993, p. 7) and, in fact, an ‘ill structured problem’ was a feature of 33.7 per cent of cases. This is in sharp contrast to the logical, step-by-step process suggested within conceptualisations of analytical decision making.Second, the non-linear nature of the decision-making process resulted in some decisions being made before the core assessment had been completed and consequently through means other than those proposed in assessment guidance. Therefore, the decision environment also seemed likely to have complicated the decision-making process so that decisions (of which 67 per cent were risk decisions) were being made using primarily experien- tial modes of decision making.Decision-making mechanismsUsing the findings from the analysis outlined in the preceding sections as a starting point, it was subsequently necessary to explore further the relation- ship between these individual, case and environmental factors and social workers’ cognitive processes using statistical methods in order to establish;Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=400 end=2480 startpage=11 endpage=11;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

Since all of the cases involved some element of experiential or intuitive decision making, it was most interesting to explore the mechanisms that were related to the use of analytical deci- sion making alongside these other cognitive processes.Initially, a basic exploration of the associations between analytical cogni- tion and each of the variables that emerged from the qualitative analysis as significant influences on the type of cognition used was undertaken using chi- square and ANOVA tests. Whilst the sample size was such that it was not possible to make inferences from these tests to the population as a whole, it was possible to use them to look at the emerging patterns in this data set. Where significant relationships were uncovered, Phi tests were then run to determine the strength and association of these relationships (Fielding and Gilbert, 2006, pp. 215–17). The resulting statistic provides a measure that ranges between –1 and 1, where zero means that there is no association and one means that there is a perfect association. Where a positive associ- ation exists (between 0 and 1), this means that, as one variable increases, so the other variable increases. Where a negative association exists (between 0 and – 1), this means that, as one variable increases, the other vari- able decreases. Table 6 shows the independent and outcome variables included in the Phi test and the strength and direction of these associations.The results shown in Table 6 show the following patterns of association existed in the data set:(1) As the level of perceived risk in a case increases, so analytical decision making increases.(2) As the social worker’s perceived level of certainty increases, analytical de- cision making decreases.(3) As familiarity with the type of case or issues raised increases, analytical decision making decreases.(4) As the amount of available historical information in a case increases, ana- lytical decision making increases.;Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=34 end=2049 startpage=12 endpage=12;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

It was there- fore necessary to explore combinations of case and environmental characteris- tics and their relationship to the cognitive decision processes, in a way which could not be achieved through simple bivariate analysis. Cluster analysis was therefore used to identify how different combinations of case and environmen- tal factors co-occurred alongside different types of decision making according to the decision context. A QCA analysis was undertaken using the nine inde- pendent variables highlighted in Table 5, together with the outcome variable ‘analytical decision making’. The results of the QCA confirmed that, whilst de- cision making was predominantly experiential, there was variation in the type of decision-making strategy used according to complex combinations of case and environmental characteristics. Specifically, the results showed that the fol- lowing causal relationships existed between combinations of case and environ- mental characteristics and the use, or not, of analytical cognition:(1) Risk decision + historical information available + a need for evidence + an uncertain dynamic environment + action/feedback loops 1⁄4 presence of analytical cognition.(2) Case type familiar + absence of an uncertain dynamic environment + absence of action/feedback loops + absence of high stakes + absence of a need for evidence 1⁄4 absence of analytical cognition.;Hackett, Taylor - 2014 - Decision Making in Social Work with Children and Families The Use of Experiential and Analytical Cognitive Proc.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=63 end=2570 startpage=13 endpage=13;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

To allow for sufficient depth of analysis and discussion within this paper, I have chosen to focus on two of the themes to emerge most strongly in the data collected:• Making sense through ‘framing’ the situation• Constructing responsibility.This research seeks to address the question ‘What are the methods by which social workers make sense of information in real-time practice situations?’ While these selected themes can be considered as distinct and separate phenomena in their own right, they are seen in this study to be complexly interrelated in practitioner’s sense-making activities. Considered together, they offer insight into the specific and situ- ated challenges of judgement in social work practice.MAKING SENSE THROUGH ‘FRAMING’ THE SITUATIONWorkers were observed to discuss cases with numer- ous people and in numerous ways across their working day. When workers were initiating the discussion with another person, they frequently started interactions with an opening statement.This opening statement or ‘frame’ appeared to act as an indicator or signifier for those elements of the dialogue which the initiator wished to emphasize as of greatest importance to their current understanding of the situation and to the current dialogue. This phenomenon was observed in both individual settings and in group settings.In the following extract, a standby social worker and a colleague discuss a case in a large shared office. The worker considered the breakdown of a child’s place- ment, with the primary focus on the emotional impact of their decision-making in this case.Joanne: ‘I feel so guilty for Kieran because I organised the placement. On the surface it was OK but I did have reserva- tions, I thought it would break down because of Kieran’s behaviour.’This frame of ‘my emotional responses’ guided col- leagues to a discussion which then helped the worker to make sense of both the feelings and past decision-making. By means of the initial frame, the interaction was steered, by mutual consent, to an important dis- cussion of the impact of this situation on the worker, which ultimately may have helped them contain these difficult feelings, explore the complex issues of causa- tion in the placement breakdown and integrate learn- ing from this experience into ongoing practice wisdom.Initial frames were not always accepted or agreed between those involved. In this next passage, the standby social worker (Jessica) has a discussion with the standby team leader (Catherine) about a message which was passed on to her by the receptionist. The standby worker provides a primary frame of ‘possible child protection’, but the team leader does not fully endorse this categorization.Jessica: ‘This is possible child protection. It’s a wee girl, Kelly Gardner, one of Pat’s (another social worker) clients.’ Catherine: (answers t/c from practice team manager) ‘2 pos- sible child protection ones . . . one of Pat’s, Kelly . . . I don’t know. Jessica says it’s child protection.’Jessica: ‘Kelly is saying very clearly that her dad assaulted her last night.’Catherine: (to Jessica) ‘What’s her age?’Jessica: ‘Seven’The team leader is focused on the subjectivity of the claim: ‘I don’t know. Jessica says it’s child protection’. The initial frame was resisted and the standby worker then offered two pieces of supplementary evidence to support their initial frame of ‘child protection’, namely the child’s ‘clear’ statement and the commis- sion of a physical assault by a parent. The social worker did not fixate on the alleged assault but offered information relating to the child’s presentation, needs and statement about her desired outcome. While ‘child protection’ was a key frame for sense-making here, the inclusion of the word ‘possible’ was crucial in signalling a level of doubt. A more rigorous and methodical consideration of the facts allowed the team leader to ascertain the nature and extent of any inju- ries, but ensured that the alleged assault did not become the sole focus of the inquiry to the detriment of the child’s wider holistic needs.The child was there- fore not lost as an individual in their own right.The following extract exemplifies the way in which emotional frames of reference can have influence on decision-making. Concern and anxiety are constant features of child welfare and protection work. Emo- tions are therefore signalled and understood within the particular social and cultural practices of the social work office.

In t…;"In this study, a significant code emerging from the data was that of ‘constructing a response’. In the process of sense-making, it was noted that the workers made sense of the data in the context of their under- standing of their professional role and the wider role of their organization. These observations suggest that professionals make sense of information with refer- ence to their specific roles and responsibilities. The following extract is a statement from the practice team manager at an allocation meeting. The discussion focused on a risk assessment of a father who had threatened to kill his children. With the risk assess- ment at an early stage, opinion about the likelihood of harm was divided between medical practitioners and addictions services. The statement offers insight into the task of sense-making in relation to professional response.Sandy: ‘Someone needs to own this. It’s either nothing or it’s way up there.’The first sentence opened up the possibility that an agency other than social work might take primary responsibility, but, given the levels of risk to the chil- dren, would appear unlikely. The nature of ‘owner- ship’ in this sentence was ambiguous, potentially encompassing a frustration about other professionals’ accountability for their risk assessments as well as a concern that a lead agency is required to coordinate the multi-professional risk assessment. The second sentence reflected the need to make a professional response that was founded on an accurate risk assess- ment. There was potential for a false-positive predic- tion of risk (unnecessary intervention where risk is predicted but harm does not occur) and a false- negative prediction (low/no intervention because risk is not predicted but harm does occur). The dilemma of the professional task is pithily but darkly con- structed in this sentence as ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’.Some passages of sense-making led quite quickly and clearly to a threshold for action (Dalgleish 2000) where a decision was made without equivocation or ambiguity. As there are relatively few areas of social work practice which are unequivocal and free of ambi- guity, these episodes were of particular interest as they may provide insight into the methods used in rapid decision-making and when such circumscribed sense- making processes may or may not be appropriate. When the threshold for action is reached, the search for further evidence stops, and the participant reachesa ‘good enough’ level of confidence in their judgement to take some form of action.In the following extract, a standby social worker takes a telephone call from reception about a looked- after child attending a birthday party. Before taking the call, the social worker checked with her manager (at the door) and checked the electronic information system. The standby worker then asked the following set of questions:Anna: ‘Is there any condition attached?Safety warrant, yes?Is Liam (child) concerned about dad being there? Will the parents be there?What do you think, Jane?Do you trust that he wouldn’t leave?’Through these questions, the standby worker has ascertained the following:• That the child is subject of compulsory measures ofcare• The child’s views about his father’s possibleattendance• The carer’s views generally, and, in particular,about Liam’s capacity for decision-making.At this point, the standby worker decided that they had sufficient information to make a decision:Anna: ‘Sounds fine to me. His parents won’t be there; he’ll be supervised; there’s a plan in place and he gets to go to the party.’The standby worker has made sense of their respon- sibility towards Liam. He must be kept safe from harm, but he must also not be denied the opportu- nities afforded to children who are not looked after. The worker appeared to have taken responsibility for a quick and intuitive risk assessment of the situation rather than delay decision-making for the return of Liam’s allocated worker. The risk assessment was by no means extensive, and it was not possible for me to ascertain how much additional information the standby worker had been provided with. However, the worker was able to clearly summarize the risk- reducing factors and the benefits accruing from the risk judgement.In the following extract, a team leader phoned another professional about a mother alleged to have bitten her daughter. It was noted that, as this was an adoptive placement, the adoption worker was con- sulted rather than an initial referral discussion (IRD) being arranged.

It is, therefore, not surprising when responding to questions about their interpretation of child neglect that 75 per cent of respondents (n = 292) considered that decisions about possible neglect should centre on the impact of the neglectful act on the child. In addition, 75 per cent of respondents (n = 292) agreed with Gibbons et al. (1995) that a high-criticism, low-warmth environment is damaging to a child and 84 per cent (n = 327) agreed with Iwaniec and McSherry (2002) that a physically neglected child is also likely to be experiencing emotional neglect.However, despite respondents recognizing that neglect can affect the health and development of a child, they appeared to differentiate between the various developmental needs of children, giving some needs greater priority than oth- ers. For example, the respondents were asked, in the questionnaire, to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement that the essential aspects of parenting are to provide merely for a child’s physical and safety needs. Forty-five per cent (n = 175) agreed, while 43 per cent (n = 168) disagreed. In addition, in prioritizing factors of concern in the chronic neglect case scenario, 135 responses focused on lack of supervision and physical harm, while only six respondents considered lack of stimulation and nine poor nurturing. A prioriti- zation on physical and safety needs can lead to the other needs of the child becoming marginalized and conflicts with the findings described above that indicated that respondents recognized what was damaging for a child. This emphasis in practice on physical needs and health and safety issues may reflect the incident-driven system which has dominated child welfare practice for over twenty years in both England and Ireland (Buckley et al., 1997; Jordan and Jor- dan, 2000; Parton et al., 1997). Practitioners working within these systems may find it is easier to identify and refer neglect by focusing on a specific incident or providing tangible evidence of physical neglect or safety issues rather than gathering evidence about the impact of neglect on the socio-emotional development of the child.The knowledge and practical wisdom used by professionals to make judge- ments about referral were also explored. The respondents in the focus groups highlighted the importance of evidence-based decision making. Yet the empha- sis among respondents in the focus groups and amongst respondents comment- ing on the case scenarios in the questionnaire was on gathering facts and information about the particular child and family rather than using research and developmental theories that could inform understanding of the informa- tion gathered. Seventy-six per cent of respondents to the questionnaire (n = 296) believed that decisions regarding child neglect were made based on professional practice experience. However, as discussed below, the respond- ents had limited experience of referring neglect, which raises questions as to what and whose experience was being utilized. Further, respondents to the questionnaire were asked whether they agreed with the statement that ‘deci- sions are made using gut feeling or intuition’. All eleven of the clinical psychol- ogists agreed with this statement, while only twenty-three (40 per cent) of the educational professionals and twenty-two (40 per cent) of the public health";Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=3419 startpage=6 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

The concept of ‘gut feeling’ was explored further in the focus groups. A theme emerged of gut feeling being considered a hunch and a sense that things were not quite right, with the majority of respondents being clear that ‘intuition is not sufficient’ when making judgements.Referral practice: interpretation of roleThe respondents to the questionnaire were asked to identify their role in terms of referring child neglect. Whilst over 90 per cent (n = 351) confirmed they had a role, thirty-seven respondents (9 per cent) stated that they did not have a referral role. These thirty-seven respondents consisted of drug and mental heath workers (n = 9) and child psychiatrists (n = 6), although some teaching staff did not con- sider referral to be part of their role. This lack of understanding of the referral role amongst these professional groups has been noted elsewhere (see, e.g. Abrahams et al., 1992; Baginsky, 2000; Falkov, 1996; Harbin and Murphy, 2000).Of the 90 per cent who did consider that they had a role in referring child neglect, the majority often completed detailed assessments of the child, the family and their situation before making a decision whether to refer a case to social work services. When asked about the types of pre-referral assessments they completed, respondents indicated that they used a variety of assessment tools, such as direct observation and taking a family history. In addition, they gathered information from within their agency and occasionally contacted other professionals.The findings indicated that there was a lack of consistency amongst respond- ents in their response to the operational threshold for making a referral. Inter- estingly, responses to case scenarios included in the questionnaire indicated variations not only between members of different professional groups, but also amongst members of the same profession. However, more common profes- sional trends were noted in responses to profession-specific group discussions of case scenarios of possible neglect. For example, pre-school and education professionals were least likely to refer immediately to the social work teams, while practitioners working with adults, hospital staff and the Garda Siochána (police) were most likely to refer immediately. The public health nurses gave more mixed responses. One explanation for these differences could be that the respondents to the questionnaire completed the questionnaire individually and relied on their own values and beliefs to inform their practice, whilst the focus group members discussed each scenario in small groups and were influenced by the values and beliefs of their peers. (The influence of peers and teams on referring practice is discussed in detail below.)Feelings and anxieties and the influence on referral practiceWoodhouse and Pengelly (1991) noted, in their study of collaboration between practitioners in the helping professions, that the nature of the task engenders";Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=17 end=3006 startpage=7 endpage=7;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
37:223;anxieties and feelings amongst practitioners that influence practice. More specifically, Pollak and…;anxieties and feelings amongst practitioners that influence practice. More specifically, Pollak and Levy (1989) found that feelings such as fear, guilt, shame, anger, control and sympathy might negatively influence professionals’ decisions to refer or act on their child protection concerns. These feelings were present amongst the respondents in the neglect study and appeared to influ- ence referral practice. For example, fear of aggression was identified by ninety respondents (23 per cent) as influencing their decisions to report neglect. These respondents noted that the presence of a physically aggressive carer could lead to standards of care being tolerated that would not normally be accepted where there were less aggressive carers. Respondents in all the focus groups expressed fear and anxiety about both verbal and physical aggression from families towards themselves and their own families. Indeed, several members of the focus groups gave examples of being physically or verbally intimidated or actually attacked following a referral, which had impacted on their professional and personal lives. Stanley and Goddard (2002) believe that fear of actual or perceived aggression may result in feelings of helplessness, acts of defensive practice and reality distortion which could leave children in vulnerable situations.Another type of fear found amongst the respondents was fear associated with making the wrong decision. For example, the GPs in their focus group described fear of litigation from carers if they referred unnecessarily. This fear was associated with concerns about a lack of skill and uncertainty with regard to identifying child neglect. They recognized that diagnosis in cases of children in need was not as certain as in many clinical situations (Bannon et al., 2003). Other professionals, notably the Garda Siochána (police) and professionals from adult services, referred to ‘watching their back’ and routinely making referrals, being fearful about not reporting a concern that could lead to the death of a child.Feelings of guilt and shame were also found to influence referral practice. These centre, according to Pollak and Levy (1989), on professionals wishing to be perceived by service users as trusting and supportive. They consequently felt guilty if they considered they were breaching client confidentiality by referring cases. These feelings were strong amongst community-based workers such as drug outreach workers, who considered trust between themselves and mem- bers of the community to be crucial.The third influence is feelings of anger and control. For example, respondents, notably education professionals, were frustrated and angry by the perceived lack of response to referrals from social work services. They also considered they had no control over the situation once a family was referred to social work services. As one respondent put it, ‘the family have entered a black hole’.Finally, feelings of sympathy for families or fears of appearing oppressive seemed to influence referral practice, with professionals making excuses for parenting behaviours to avoid making a referral. This was most evident in dis- cussions amongst focus group members with regard to distinguishing between neglect and social deprivation. The respondents were anxious and reluctant to make judgements about poverty and parenting when they believed, in a similarThe Missing Assessment Domain 1293;Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=3441 startpage=8 endpage=8;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

Man- aging this may be easier if more jurisdictions follow many American states and make a distinction between neglect, which is within the carer’s control, and deprivation that is beyond their control (National Clearing House on Child Abuse and Neglect, no date).From the outside looking in: perceptions of social work practiceWhilst 20 per cent of the respondents (n = 78) to the questionnaire stated that nothing prevented them referring suspected cases of child neglect to the social work teams, a theme of the focus group discussions was that some professionals regarded making a referral to social workers as a formality and did not expect the referral would result in a positive outcome for the child and family. It would appear that these professionals were, as described above, referring out of a sense of fear or obligation, or, as one disability social worker put it:Nothing stops me making a referral but there is a feeling that nothing will happen and won’t be followed up unless in a crisis situation.A minority of professionals, notably public health nurses, described very posit- ive experiences of referring cases of child neglect to social work services. How- ever, the majority of the respondents described more negative experiences. This is significant, bearing in mind that 40 per cent of respondents (n = 156) indicated that their decisions to refer cases were influenced by previous responses from social workers. However, 52 per cent of respondents (n = 203) had not made a referral of child neglect in the last year and 18 per cent (n = 17) had made only one referral. It would seem, therefore, that the majority of respondents’ attitudes towards social work services were not based on ongoing experience. This raises questions about the basis for their opinions. It could be that they were based on experiences of making other types of referral or on the experiences of colleagues. Alternatively, it could be hearsay or myths, rather than reality, that were influencing perceptions.Irrespective of the basis for the opinions, the following four issues emerged from the study which appeared to negatively influence referral to statutory social work services.Lack of communication and feedbackLack of communication from social workers following a referral leaves profes- sionals feeling ineffectual, powerless and uncertain as to what is happening to a child (Cleaver et al., 2004; Ferguson and O’Reilly, 2001; Holland, 2004). Twenty-two per cent of respondents (n = 86) to the questionnaire in this study stated that better communication with social workers following referral would improve referral practice, whilst a further 10 per cent (n = 39) indicated that";Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=17 end=2785 startpage=9 endpage=9;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
37:225;poor communication and feedback negatively influenced their referral practice. A hospital profession…;"poor communication and feedback negatively influenced their referralpractice. A hospital professional summarized the problem:... lack of communication, not enough liaison ... slow, poor follow up.The respondents in the focus groups described their anxiety about being left to work with a child and family unsure of what, if anything, was happening with regard to the referral. As the hospital professional quoted above went on to describe, this left her feeling frustrated, angry and unsupported. The focus group respondents indicated that they often did not know what procedures were followed once a referral had been made to social work services. They also described a lack of knowledge about who was actually taking the referral. In some cases, they believed they had been speaking to a receptionist, in other cases a trained duty worker. As Burton (1996) found in her study of GPs’ refer- ral practice, this lack of information about the person taking the referral can act as a barrier to referral. She noted that some respondents in her small-scale study were reluctant to discuss case detail without knowing about the qualifica- tions and experience of the person taking the referral.Poor staff continuityEffective communication is likely to occur if professionals develop sound working relationships (Bell, 2001; Hallett, 1995; Horwath and Calder, 1998; Murphy, 1995; Stevenson, 2005). When this takes place, professionals are more likely to have the confidence to contact social workers to discuss concerns about a child. As a Garda (police officer) in the study put it:Trust in the exchange of information is vital but takes time and continuity to build up.And a GP stated:I need to put a face to a name and strike up better liaison so there is room for informal discussion and to instil more confidence.One of the barriers to achieving effective working relationships, as indicated by the respondents, was high staff turnover within social work departments. This is as prevalent in the UK as it is in Ireland (Cm (5860), 2003; Jones, 2001). Respondents indicated that high staff turnover resulted in skilled, experienced workers leaving and being replaced by newly qualified and inexperienced staff whom they did not consider had the skill to manage highly complex referrals, which affected their willingness to discuss case details.Lack of accessOnly 29 per cent of the questionnaire respondents (n = 115) stated that they never had a problem contacting social workers, while 50 respondents (13 per cent)";Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=35 end=2561 startpage=10 endpage=10;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

Those who shared the same building as social workers clearly had the easiest access and were most likely to dis- cuss their concerns with social workers. They found this particularly useful prior to making a referral, as they were able to discuss a situation and obtain advice before providing the actual name and details of a family. This approach is in line with the English What to do if... guidance (Department of Health et al., 2003). However, these respondents noted that accessibility could have negative consequences for children. For example, important information shared informally about families was often not recorded, meaning that professionals could potentially make different assumptions about the outcomes of these informal discussions.Professionals who were dependent on telephoning or writing to social workers to make a referral were less likely to have informal discussions about a case. These professionals described the frustrations of ‘poor availability and left messages not returned’. Lack of accessibility exacerbates problems of poor communication between professionals. In addition, lack of opportunity to hold discussions can lead to inappropriate decisions not to make a referral (Burton, 1996; Lagerberg, 2001).Perceptions of social work practiceSome of the decisions of professionals to refer cases were not based on the merits of the situation alone, but rather on the professionals’ perception of social work practice following referral. For example, 51 per cent of the GPs (n = 30) described how perceptions of the consequences for the child and fam- ily influenced their decision to refer. Doctors expressed reluctance to refer if they did not believe that a referral would lead to service provision or improve the situation for the family. This is commensurate with other findings (Burton, 1996; Haeringen et al., 1998; Polnay, 2000). Woodhouse and Pengelly (1991, p. 232) found that the anxiety generated by a particular type of problem resulted in members of the professional network referring cases to the agency ‘seen as specially competent and responsible in that area’. Professionals in the study, who did not perceive social work services to be competent in terms of providing the necessary services for the particular child, tended to monitor cases or refer to other professionals in the community. As a pre-school profes- sional said, ‘Referral to social workers is a last resort’.The respondents to the questionnaire held diverse views about social work practice—views which were likely to influence referral practice. For example, in response to a statement that social workers accept lower standards of parenting than other professionals who come into contact with children and families, 25 per cent (n = 97) agreed with the statement, 45 per cent (n = 175) disagreed and 28 per cent (n = 109) were unsure. They were also asked whether the criteria for accepting a referral depended on the judgement of the individ- ual social worker taking the referral.

These threshold problems are particularly likely to occur when there is a general lack of agreement over working definitions of abuse and the criteria for a child in need (Cleaver et al., 2004). Scott (1997) found that in this situation, referrers are more liable to emphasize the elements of a case which will trigger social workers’ concerns. This is most likely to occur if referrers perceive social services in the same way as respondents to this study and those in Woodhouse and Pengelly’s study (1991, p. 231) did: ‘... as a citadel under siege whose occupants kept an ever watchful eye on the portal.’The working context and cultureFindings from the study indicated that it was not only personal and profes- sional perspectives that influenced referral practice, but also the working context and culture, most specifically the community in which professionals practised and their team members.The communityThe Board covered both rural and urban communities. As a result of the nature of the region, a significant number of respondents lived and worked within the same community, which, as Lehmann (2005, p. 356) notes, makes them more ‘visible’ than if they worked in urban settings. It is therefore not surprising that personal knowledge and associations with children and families in the community influenced referral practice. Twenty-five per cent of all respondents and, notably, five out of the six drug outreach workers agreed that personal knowledge and association influenced their decision to refer or not refer. Pugh (2000, p. 113) notes that fear of being ‘found out’ by the community and the consequences for the referrer and their family may influence decisions not to refer. For example, a nursery manager said:We also have to consider that our business could be affected and we would lose our livelihood.The other concern centred on the consequences of the referral for the family. Respondents who worked in small rural communities were worried about the way in which the family would be perceived if members of the community knew they had been referred to social work services for child neglect.The Missing Assessment Domain 12971298 Jan HorwathThe influence of the team and team managerRespondents to the questionnaire were asked whether the views of supervisors and managers were taken into account when deciding whether to refer. Forty per cent of GPs (n = 24) and 55 per cent of public health nurses (n = 31) disa- greed with this statement, while the other professional groups tended to agree with it. This is understandable, from the GPs’ perspective, as they are not managed in the same way as other professionals. In the case of the public health nurses, their managers may not have expertise in the area of child protection. The other respondents indicated that the manager had two roles: first, assisting practitioners in identifying neglect and, second, advising practitioners on courses of action.It was not only the manager but also members of the team who appeared to influence decisions to refer. As described above, the influences of peers was apparent when comparing the range of individual responses of members of the same professional group to case scenarios included in the questionnaire and the more standardized responses when respondents worked with peers on case scenarios in the focus groups. Over sixty respondents in the focus groups high- lighted the influence played by the team on decision making. For example, one of the teachers stated:We try and create a culture of care within the school, so that we all can identify neglect and that collective wisdom will prevail.The problem with ‘collective wisdom’ is that, as Brown (1996) notes, individuals can conform to the attitudes and behaviours of the majority, denying the evidence of their own senses to meet group norms. Based on this study, the setting of group norms was influenced by the team’s actual or perceived experiences of referring child neglect; perceptions of social work services and access to work- ers; and factors that the team considered important indicators of neglect. Woodhouse and Pengelly (1991) argue these attitudes and behaviours vary amongst different professional groups. They concluded that professionals use team practices, values and ways of interpreting guidance and procedures as strategies for managing the specific type of anxiety associated with the task that is experienced by the particular group of professionals, e.g. the GPs’ fear of litigation.";Horwath - 2007 - The Missing Assessment Domain Personal, Professional and Organizational Factors Influencing Professional Judgements whe.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=2344 startpage=12 endpage=13;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

The women ranged in age from 26 to 49 years and came from various cultural backgrounds. Almost half of the women (5) identified as an immigrant/refugee, having been in Canada between 5 and 12 years. The majority of women were on social assistance, most (8) earning less than $25,000 annually. Almost half of the sample (5) had a College/University education, two women had completed high school, and four women had completed grades 9–11.4.2. Summary of findings: theoretical coding4.2.1. Doing the right thing: managing risk to increase safetyThe quality of this data was rich, with the identified themes present in the majority of the interviews. Data were taken from thematic analy- sis to a level of abstraction that identified the relationships between the categories to lead to the final refinement of an overarching core catego- ry, ‘Doing the Right Thing.’ This core category reflected the goals for both workers and women to achieve the desired outcome from their interac- tion; to manage risk and increase safety. It comprises four sub- categories: Getting the Picture, Getting Connected, Getting Through, and Getting Out, to illustrate the process of interaction being worker and client during investigation.4.2.2. Getting the picture: assessing the impact of abuse and risk of re- involvement“How do we really know?... you get a snapshot of these people's lives, you get a bit of information, you see the clients a couple of times. I think I'd be irresponsible to say that there's been times I haven't missed risk.”[Worker #3]This subcategory illustrates how CPS workers and clients interact in the process of investigation; each trying to assess the risk of CPS in- volvement (and potential for re-involvement). Parties attempt to gauge their approach to one another based on the nature of the referral, the client's history of involvement with CPS, and how the client's per- spectives of their abuse influence the worker's perceptions. These com- ponents are taken into consideration in order to get the picture of what is happening and ‘do the right thing’ in terms of decision-making, to lower the risk of re-involvement:“Part of our jobs is to get as much information as you can right? .... I've got 30 days to put it together — do I close this? ... it has to do with how you assess the situation — actually the questions you ask, the informa- tion you get, the responses you get .... So you weigh all those things but you're going by your gut feelings, your skills, experiences, I don't know what else — I don't have any magic, I can tell you that.”[Worker #10]As clients enter the system, they attempt to interpret the level of risk involved in the investigation (e.g., having their children apprehended, or managing an abusive partner in this context) and try to do the right thing for themselves and their children. Most of the women shared an initial distrust of the system due to a lack of knowledge about the pro- cess, which contributed to unnecessary anxiety and negative experi- ences for clients. Participants often struggled with how truthful to be; presenting an outward appearance of cooperating with the investiga- tion while not disclosing the violence, considered a form of self- protection from the consequences of intervention. Clients understood however, that this omission significantly altered the course of the inter- vention: “I mean I can't entirely blame them because I didn't tell them the truth, right?” It was part of this participant's self-preservation, as most importantly, she feared the ramifications from her abuser:“... as soon as I admit to something they now have to go through a pro- cess, and if that had happened? Then it wouldn't have been ‘is he going to kill me?’ it probably would have been ‘he would have killed me’ solike, I'm not going to risk my life just, just so that they can have the truth. As awful as that sounds, my life is more important to me than their paperwork.”[Client #1]Women's ideas about what constituted risk may have contrasted with the professionals' ideas, inadvertently putting clients at further risk for more intrusive intervention. It became clear that how women consider risk is often not in line with what professionals think.Workers used client history as a means of ‘getting a feel for’ the client's perspective, determining “what they've been through in their life that maybe have led them to be with somebody or stay with somebody that's abusive” (CPS FG Participant). For clients, an additional compo- nent was whether they had prior experiences with CPS. Exploring client history with CPS is often the first step of an investigation. Files that came to the attention of child protection services for the third or fourth time were considered particularly problematic and higher risk evident by this focus group excerpt:FGP1: we end up getting so intrusive with the moms because they keep doing it and they're really not realizing the impact on their kids even though it's not about intent like you know they aren't intentionally ....FGP4: they just have no clue.FGP3: they can't see it.FGP1: and we get so intrusive with them ... we get really down on them. So the first probably two times we go out on a new case of domestic violence we're, you know, you're the victim and we recognize all that kind of stuff and how can we help you be safe and make changes for you, but then after two or three times you're like, “listen lady! You need to protect your kids and you're putting” — and you know we get, we take a much harder line because again we need to ensure kids are safe.It was important for workers to try to obtain women's perspectives on the abuse experiences, and for women it was important that workers heard their stories in order to understand the context of their lives. However, some clients felt that the conduct of an investigation was in- adequate to truly assess the ‘real story’ of women's lives:“You can come and invade my home and ask me invasive questions and look in my fridge and check my daughter — but that's not doing any- thing. Because you can look at her and see that she's fed and she's got a smile on her face and there's some basic things that are there but I'm telling you and she's telling you some pretty serious things have happened to us.”[Client #5]How clients accounted for the violence was extremely important and taken by workers as a means of understanding the level of risk: “so it's what I see, what it looks like, what they've said, — and a risk assess- ment doesn't speak to that,” (Worker #4). This assisted them in the decision-making process, often conflicting with requirements to comply with the organizational mandate to utilize actuarial risk assessment as the only ‘right way’ to assess risk:“The risk assessment that we have right now measures the risk that the family will come back to the attention of the society ... we don't have any tools really that are approved to measure risk that perpetrator [presents] ... there's no tool that measures the risk to the woman that is something that we can use. ... the risk doesn't really measure any- thing as far as I'm concerned. It's just a bunch of like literally boxes and checkmark, checkmark, checkmark ....”[Worker #6]Although several participants believed that the involvement of their partners in the investigation increased their risk, most women thought workers were missing the most important part of the investigation thus only getting part of ‘the story.’ Many participants found the lack of involvement with their abusive partner as problematic, feeling it";Jenney et al. - 2014 - Doing the right thing (Re) Considering risk assessment and safety planning in child protection work with domestic.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=7601 startpage=3 endpage=3;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
40:167;a lot that she dealt with, she was especially worried about me being iso- lated in the country ... s…;"a lot that she dealt with, she was especially worried about me being iso- lated in the country ... she used to always tell me to watch out, not to be very isolated too much, try to you know have support ....”[Client #8]Not surprising, the longer a client is connected to the same worker, the better the chances of developing a strong relationship with that person.“Five years, same woman, all same — then I start to tell them everything then they said why you didn't tell me before? Then I tell them you know I was so scared that time like I feel safe with them to talk about every- thing then my children aid worker she find out shelter for me.”[Client #9] And in the words of one worker, long-term involvement is what cli-ents need in order to get the full benefit of services:“You need to actually be a long term client in order to actually get theservices that you need, which is really sad right?”[Worker #3]Not all experiences of workers were positive however, and criticism often related to relational aspects: “she could've been more um — I don't know how to say these words, but caring?” (Client #10). Interestingly, one of the women's main criticisms of CPS was that they should have done “more” for clients. Despite not wanting their involvement in the first place, once they had open files, there seemed to be an expectation by clients, of receiving more beneficial services. One client differentiated between workers who opened and closed her case in the past and one that kept it open for a while:“I liked her a lot better, like how she dealt with everything, how she kept it open a little longer made me feel better — made me feel like she was looking into it because [child] is, is clearly like, you know affected by it.”[Client #5]In one scenario, the participant advised that she wouldn't want to reconnect with her worker in her current state, “because she'd prob- ably be disappointed and all that,” referring to the fact that she was once again living in a shelter. This woman, still affected by the rela- tionship with her worker, commented, “she used to give me a lot of en- couragement, tell me I was doing a good job in spite of you know all the circumstances?” Further, she still kept the contact in mind to help get her through difficult periods, “just thinking of her words does help you know, when I'm being a bit hard on myself as a mom” (Client #8). These examples provide further support to the idea that some clients inter- nalize the workers as caring about them. This sense of the impor- tance of the worker/client relationship is illustrated by these two participants:“relationship building is huge — empathizing, being honest. I'm often just a bottom line guy if and if I don't feel that they are getting it, so to speak, I'll just be honest. I'll just let them know that, that I'm concerned that you're not understanding the risk and so we will be involved to help you manage the risk and this is what it will look like. ... I mean my prac- tice has changed over the years from probably being more directive and non-understanding, I'd even say insensitive, to more understanding, sensitive ....”[Worker #3]“The support that I get from my workers now is guidance, understand- ing, compassion — direction you know? ... I believe a person needs to have an open mind about what that worker is suggesting not — back in my day I would think when they were making suggestions I thought they were just ganging up on me — that's where the compassion part comes in. If a person can understand or try to understand what thatperson needs — then the support will follow ... it's a very helpful way to get what you want in your life and get to where you're supposed to — where you want to be.”[Client #11]These excerpts make the connection between building relationships with clients, even in the negative context of multiple openings, as a means of managing risk by being able to effect some change; to eventu- ally, ‘get through’ to each other on some level.4.2.4. Getting through: understanding the impact on children, developing safety plans, and managing contact with the abusive partnerThis sub-category encompasses how CPS workers view the need to educate clients about the dynamics of woman abuse and the impact on children in order to influence them to ‘do the right thing’ with regards to acknowledging the impact of abuse and planning for safety. It is also about how women try to get through to workers what they need from them to assist them in dealing with the abuse they have ex- perienced, survive and move on. It is also how the work of CPS is con- ceptualized, and how workers understand why clients make decisions they do not consider good choices. All of the workers talked about feel- ing frustrated and conflicted working with clients who aren't doing what the worker would like them to do. Workers justified the need to educate clients believing they had a more objective perspective, and saw the main goal of child protection work as helping mothers under- stand their risk (as the worker sees it) so they will comply with the ac- tions workers consider necessary to decrease risk to children, increase safety and eventually lead to less intervention:“... with our agency and our mandate we have no choice but to get more intrusive and we have to pretty much stay involved if we feel there's a risk. I just had a really bad one — she just was not getting it, not leaving, and you know, doing what we wanted her to do — so we had to go for a supervision order so you know we do have to kind of — we don't want to threaten them with court but ... it ultimately could come to that.”[FG Participant #3]As part of educating, workers would inform women of the process of involvement, what abuse looked like, how it impacted children and other issues in order to motivate women to make change. They would often provide information about resources to facilitate compliance, such as connecting women with counseling or shelters.4.2.5. Getting out: ‘doing the right thing’ as ending relationships and case closureThe final category illustrates the theme whereby clients are consid- ered successful upon having ended abusive relationships and whereby CPS workers are considered successful when they close the case. It emerged that women understood, through the advice of their workers, there were certain things they needed to learn to minimize CPS involve- ment: 1) the impact of the abuse on children, 2) safety planning, and 3) managing contact with the abuser.Half of the participants indicated that they had not understood the extent to which their children had been impacted by their exposure to abuse, which CPS workers had brought to their attention. However, focus by CPS on the impact of abuse on children didn't necessarily trans- late into workers recognizing that children may need further support such as counseling or other programs to help them deal with their expe- riences. Part of educating clients entailed workers offering suggestions to increase safety, many from the VAW literature since there were sim- ilarities in all of the transcripts with respect to the content of a good safety plan. Although formally asked about safety plans, many women either had not been involved in safety planning (or did not recall doing so) with their workers. This finding is of particular concern as safety planning is a core feature of CPS practice with woman abuse cases. The fact that the majority of the clients did not recall safetyA. Jenney et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 47 (2014) 92–101 9798 A. Jenney et al. / Children and Youth Services Review 47 (2014) 92–101planning with their workers is an area for further exploration. Most par- ticipants recollected safety planning with a VAW worker, indicating that perhaps at the point of CPS investigation, women do not feel safe enough to hold onto the information that would be necessary to lower their risk. This is a critical argument for the importance of engagement as a form of risk management.It is necessary to understand the multiple components of what makes a woman feel safe in order to take all actions into account. There were instances in which women chose actions they perceived as increasing their safety (e.g., recanting after making a police report), which from the perspective of the child protection or police system may have been seen as increasing their risk. Some workers believed that engaging women in creating their own safety plans was a relational technique that increased the chances of the effectiveness of that plan. They also understood that they couldn't always change clients, which was an inherent reality in their work. This belief was always related to the attempt to convince women to leave an abusive partner; considered by workers the most effective form of safety plan.Throughout the involvement, workers and women struggled to find ways of managing the participation of abusers in the process. Clients struggled with how to manage the contact with the father of their chil- dren, often wishing CPS workers would be more involved. Decisions to leave or to stay and manage the risk were at the forefront for both workers and clients. When there was an expectation for women to end relationships with abusive partners, there was a clear expectation that clients would manage the contact in a way that maximized safety for themselves and their children. Part of this method of influencing, was the messaging that women said they received from workers that leaving their partners was always the desired action and that it would result in decreased involvement on the part of CPS.Ultimately, client participants related experiences of how they con- sidered risk within the consequences of investigation and the complex and multi-faceted aspects of disclosure. Engagement with workers and whether that relationship was experienced as beneficial was im- portant. In order to mitigate risk, clients needed to talk about safety; what it means to them, how it is achieved and whether they are able to ‘do the right thing’, in the eyes of the worker and the system. This ability to “do the right thing” appears to relate directly to how the sys- tem responds to women's situations and then how women ultimately find themselves living with risk as a consequence of involvement with the system.Both workers and clients appear to be working within the confines of the social construction/collective representation of woman abuse and the work of child protection. Woman abuse and child protection work have been socially constructed (through media, social policy, etc.) and all the participants seem to draw on these ‘collective represen- tations’ of what each term symbolizes; for example, images of abused women as passive, innocent victims and child protection as about apprehending children. It emerged through analysis that workers and clients develop a shared meaning of woman abuse, what constitutes risk and safety with respect to child protection and DV, and what is con- sidered to be the appropriate response by women and workers.";Jenney et al. - 2014 - Doing the right thing (Re) Considering risk assessment and safety planning in child protection work with domestic.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=0 end=3529 startpage=5 endpage=6;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018

CPT professional case disposition decisions about inflicted injuriesCPT professionals rated the severity of inflicted injuries in all case vignettes as between minor to moderate severity (Vignette A: M = 2.53, SD=.67; B: M=2.67, SD=.68; C: M=2.45, SD=.74; D: M=2.82, SD=.69; E: M=2.81, SD=.66; F: M=2.72, SD=.74; G: M=2.39, SD = .75; and H: M = 2.92, SD = .69). Overall, CPT professionals displayed relatively high agreement in that any inflicted injury that left a mark was substantiated as child physical abuse. That is, in 6 of the 8 vignettes CPT professionals displayed high inter-rater agreement (N 80%) in classifying inflicted injuries as physical abuse when presented with the same evidence (Vignette A = 81%, B = 88.4%, D = 91.9%, E = 91.2%, F = 85.7%, and H = 96.3%). Of the six vignettes that were classified as physical abuse at least 80% of the time, multiple grouping of marks were present in 5 of the 6 vignettes and a belt was used to inflict the injuries in 4 out of the 6 vignettes. Finally, agreement was highest for the classification of physical abuse in Case Vignette H, which depicted a child who was hit in the face with an open hand that resulted in a bruise to the child's cheek. This result suggests that CPT professionals consider the location of injuries in their decision-making process (i.e., because injuries to the head have theTable 2Correlations between case-specific and professional characteristics and case disposition decisions.Characteristic Vignette A disposition Vignette B disposition Vignette C disposition Vignette F disposition Vignette G dispositionCase characteristics Child's ageRaceEthnicityChild behaviorParent affectFamily's tendency to use physical punishment Severity of inflicted injuriesProfessional characteristics AgeGenderRaceProfessional disciplineEducationCase exposureParental statusBeliefs about acceptability of corporal discipline Coercive discipline techniquesNon-coercive discipline techniques(n = 137) −.01 −.04 −.06.14.15 −.02.27⁎⁎.05 (n = 135).03 (n = 137) −.18⁎ (n=137) −.06 (n = 137).05 (n = 136).02 (n = 136) −.04 (n = 137) −.11 (n = 133) −.18⁎ (n=133) −.11 (n = 132)(n = 138) −.13 −.16 −.05 −.07.09 .01 .22⁎⁎.02 (n = 137) −.04 (n = 138) −.20⁎ (n=138) −.05 (n = 138).16 (n = 138) −.04 (n = 137) −.01 (n = 138) −.04 (n = 134) −.10 (n = 134)b−.01 (n = 133)(n=136) (n=133) (n=136)−.10 −.13 .10 −.02 .01 −.05.38⁎⁎.07 (n = 135)−.10 (n = 136) .02 (n = 136) −.08 (n = 136).22⁎⁎ (n = 136) −.07 (n=135) .10 (n=136)−.26⁎⁎ (n = 133) −.10 (n = 133) .01 (n=132)−.05 −.04 −.04 −.04 −.03.01 .31⁎⁎−.06 (n = 132) −.07 (n = 133) −.10 (n = 133).02 (n = 133).14 (n = 133) b .01 (n=132) b−.01 (n=133)−.19⁎ (n = 129) −.13 (n = 129) −.08 (n=129).04 .11 .01 .08 .12 .03 .45⁎⁎b .01 (n = 135) −.12 (n = 136) −.04 (n = 136).02 (n=136) −.03 (n = 136) −.10 (n = 135)b−.01 (n=136) −.02 (n = 132) −.11 (n = 132) −.09 (n=131)Note.

It is possible that this injury was classified less frequently asphysical abuse because the location (i.e., buttocks) and implement (i.e., hand) are very similar to common corporal discipline methods with the only difference being an injury classified as a mark. In Case Vignette G, the parent scratched the child on the neck, which resulted in abrasions consistent with fingernail marks. Of the eight case vignettes, CPT professionals perceived the severity of this inflicted injury as less severe than any of the other injuries.3.2. The extent that bias influences substantiation decisionsThe results of the binomial logistic regression analyses are displayed in Table 3. Chi-square analyses were significant across all five models suggesting that that there is adequate fit of the data to the models. CPT professionals' perceptions of the severity of inflicted injuries significantly predicted respondents' decisions to classify inflicted injuries as physical abuse across all five case vignettes. Specifically, for a 1-unit increase in perceived severity of inflicted injury, odds were approximately four times greater that respondents would decide that inflicted injuries represented physical abuse across all five case vignettes (average OR of 3. 96).CPT professionals' race significantly predicted substantiation de- cisions in three out of the five case vignettes. That is, the odds of classifying inflicted injuries as physical abuse rather than corporal discipline are reduced by an average factor of .19 if the respondent was Other race rather than White in Case Vignettes A, B, and F.Other CPT professional characteristics impacted decision-making in specific instances, but not across vignettes. For example, CPT professionals' education level significantly predicted the decision to classify inflicted injuries described as “two blue/purple strap marks and a nearby smaller bruise on the lateral aspect of the right arm” (Case Vignette B) as physical abuse. Professionals with advanced degrees (Master's degree or higher) were approximately 3.5 times more likely to classify these injuries as physical abuse as opposed to professionals with Bachelor's degrees. Also, respondents' beliefs about the acceptability of corporal discipline were predictive of the decision to classify Case Vignette C injuries, “patterned petechial bruising forming the negative partial imprint of a hand on the left buttock,” as physical abuse. That is, professionals who rated the use of corporal discipline as more acceptable were less likely to classify the injury as physical abuse by an average factor of .37. Professionals' beliefs about the acceptability of coercive discipline failed to significantly impact decision making about physical abuse substantiation across all case vignettes.";Jent et al. - 2011 - Multidisciplinary child protection decision making about physical abuse Determining substantiation thresholds and b.pdf;Structure: Findings Results;1;;start=3660 end=5400 startpage=3 endpage=4;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018;Stefan Kleipoedszus;12/10/2018
