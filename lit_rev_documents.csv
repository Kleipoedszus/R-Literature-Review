It is not clear how the focus groups were set up (what criteria were used to select participants?). Main issue in my view is that the questions (p. 56) invite for a retrospective positive construction of answers which is fueled by the the presence of other members in the group. Participants are likely to provide desireable answers. This is being discussed yet there does not seem to be any effort to mitigate against these limitations.";Stefan Kleipoedszus;23/01/2017;Stefan Kleipoedszus;28/03/2017;
