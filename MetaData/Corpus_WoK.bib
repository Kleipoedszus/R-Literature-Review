Abstract = {{This paper explores the ways in which practitioners in children and
   family social work teams make sense of information in their work. By
   examining observations and recordings from an ethnographic study, the
   paper focuses on how informal discussions within the office space inform
   and affect social workers' analysis (or sense-making). Three elements of
   sense-making activity are illustrated with vignettes and extracts from
   field notes: methodical doubt, proximity/reflexivity and security. These
   three distinct features of practice are then discussed and the
   significance of the findings considered in relation to contemporary
   practice. The paper highlights the importance of informal interaction
   and discussion in the social work office as part of the process of
   social workers' sense-making. It indicates that feelings of trust and
   security may be linked to intellectual curiosity and an ability to work
   with uncertainty in sense-making. Ethnography can provide a means of
   illuminating this complex and inaccessible element of practice and the
   findings add to the body of knowledge. Practitioners and organisations
   may wish to reflect on the findings and consider how they contribute to,
   and are affected by, such cultures and practices. Copyright (c) 2017

Abstract = {{There has been intense controversy about the appropriate response to
   child sexual exploitation, with debates in the UK particularly hinging
   on the meaning of consent and coercion. For professionals with a duty to
   safeguard young people from child sexual exploitation, a key site of
   tension is how to avoid limiting young people's experience of agency
   without placing them at risk. Drawing on new qualitative research
   findings from a vignette study designed to trace professional perception
   and decision-making, this paper argues that practitioners' perceptions
   regarding what counts as consent are refracted through conceptions of
   age and choice. However, many initial perceptions of agency and its
   links to age were modified through the interview process. This has
   implications for how supervision should operate. These topics raise
   issues of the need for practitioners to have nuanced conceptions of
   consent in the context of manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{This qualitative research was designed to evaluate the extent to which a
   national reform in Israeli child protection decision making committees
   was achieving its aim to strengthen professional judgment through
   introducing a new standard tools package into practice. Twenty-one case
   studies of families referred to the committee were investigated and
   followed up after six months. Data were collected through interviews
   with social workers, field observations of the committees' discussions
   and document review. Using a systems approach as a conceptual framework,
   everyday practice was studied within its organizational context. A key
   finding of the research was a very limited utilization of the tools in
   practice. Evidence showed no advanced performance in the few cases where
   the tools were used, and that when they were used they mainly operated
   to record customary practice. Follow up data provided limited evidence
   of improvement in the safety and well-being of vulnerable children. The
   analysis revealed several systemic factors that interfered with the
   tools being fully and successfully implemented, including pressure of
   workloads, practitioners' inadequate skills, limited professional
   support, and an organizational culture that discouraged sound practice.
   The research directs attention to the organizational changes needed in
   order to enhance the provision of effective help for children and
   families. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from several countries has shown the over-representation of
   racial/ethnic minority groups in child protection services (CPS). The
   objective of the present study was to explore whether racial/ethnic and
   socio-economic biases influence Spanish CPS caseworkers' judgements of
   the severity of child maltreatment. Moreover, the study attempted to
   explore the influence on these judgements of the use of structured
   instruments and professional experience. Two case vignettes of child
   maltreatment were presented to 405 CPS caseworkers and 169 students of
   social work and psychology. Family ethnic origin and income were
   manipulated in the vignettes. The findings showed no statistical
   evidence of biases related to family ethnic origin or socio-economic
   status (SES) in Spanish CPS caseworkers' judgements of maltreatment
   severity. Biases related to family SES were found for students for the
   vignettes of physical abuse. CPS caseworkers and students who did not
   use a structured instrument to assess maltreatment severity tended to
   underestimate the severity for the vignettes of parental incapacity to
   control child/adolescent behaviour and to overestimate it for the
   vignettes of physical abuse. CPS caseworkers who used a structured
   instrument showed higher percentages of accuracy and inter-rater
   agreement, supporting the relevance of structured tools in reducing
   potential caseworkers' biases.}},

Abstract = {{Many decisions in the child welfare arena revolve around the concept of
   children's best interests', but determining what they actually consist
   of is contestable and subject to conflicting criteria. This article
   describes the content of children's best interests' discourses used by
   social workers and parents as part of decision-making rationales.
   Findings This study found that the construction of children's best
   interests' was underpinned by concepts related to children's needs.
   Needs were framed as emotional needs best met by family relationships,
   and theorised primarily using attachment theory. This resulted in
   decisions that tended to favour stability over change, as children's
   distress on separation, indiscriminate affection, and difficult
   behaviours were interpreted as evidence of attachment problems that
   should lead to decisions to retain stable caregiving arrangements. The
   use of attachment theory was not straightforward, and illustrates the
   uneasy juxtapositions of conflicting discourses impacting on child
   welfare decision-making, particularly the influence of policy
   orientation.
   Applications These conflicts highlight the contested child welfare
   domain, and the contextualised interpretations required of attachment
   theories in decision-making contexts in order to make sound decisions
   for specific children. Implications for practice and education are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The child protection workers' attitude toward responsibility for child
   safety is complex and requires further examination. Using the Quality
   Improvement Project on Differential Response data from Illinois we
   examined the characteristics that influence worker attitude towards
   child safety. The attitude variable measures workers' belief in family
   responsibility for child safety compared to state responsibility for
   child safety. Regression analyses suggest that self-perception of
   skills, confidence in community resources, confidence in the child
   protection system, and worker age significantly predict worker attitude.
   Findings support organizations to direct resources towards shifting
   attitudes in the direction that favors agency mandate and needs.}},

Abstract = {{Examining the concepts underpinning the reasoning processes of social
   worker's decision-making provides important insights into how social
   work practice is undertaken. This paper examines one of the major
   discourses used by social workers in decision reasoning in a
   non-governmental organization child protection context in Aotearoa/New
   Zealand: family maintenance. This study found that family maintenance as
   a concept was strongly privileged by social workers. This resulted in
   attempts to preserve families and created a hierarchy of preferred
   decision outcomes. A preference for family maintenance was supported by
   legal, moral, psychological and Mori cultural concepts. This pattern of
   constructs underpinned the weighing up of harms' when considering
   removal, and generally reflected a child welfare orientation. In
   addition to this, it was found that family' was broadly defined, and
   could include people who had a relationship with the children, or Mori
   definitions of extended family, in addition to legal ones.}},

Abstract = {{The nature and quality of social work decision making have been
   highlighted in recent years by a number of high-profile child deaths.
   Recognising and assessing child abuse is beset with uncertainties and
   complexities that profoundly shape practice yet are often overlooked by
   more official and distanced accounts. This paper draws on ethnographic
   data from a study of social workers' decision making to uncover some of
   the issues they faced in gathering and assessing information. Workers
   faced problems with inaccurate or incomplete information, poorly defined
   situations, time pressures and heavy workloads. The paper draws
   attention to the ways in which the team organised itself to manage these
   issues which could provide a better understanding of how everyday
   decision making can be supported and improved.}},

Abstract = {{Social workers are routinely required to make finely balanced judgements
   on matters defined by subjectivity and uncertainty. Often, these
   judgements have to be made on the basis of information which is
   incomplete, inconclusive and contested. The way in which social workers
   make sense of such information is a crucial component of effective
   assessment and intervention. This ethnographic study of judgements in a
   social work office describes some of the practices which practitioners
   employed in making sense of information about children and young
   people's needs. The findings suggest that initial statements in dialogue
   may potentially act as signposts for preceding intuitive sense-making.
   Observations offer insights into the way in which individuals construct
   professional responsibility. The study also suggests that sense-making
   is not necessarily an individual activity but can be an activity which
   is shared between people and across teams. The findings indicate the
   importance of emotional intelligence and intersubjectivity in social
   work judgements.}},

Abstract = {{The study, carried out in Israel, explores the question of whether
   professionals' status and experience moderate the relationships between
   their attitudes and their assessments and decisions on removal. It
   compares the associations between attitudes towards issues in child
   welfare, maltreatment, risk assessments and decisions of three groups of
   respondents: social work students and less and more experienced child
   protection social workers. The sample of 210 workers and 263 social work
   students filled out an attitudes questionnaire and responded to a
   written vignette showing a case of alleged child maltreatment. Compared
   with students, practitioners were more against removal, more in favour
   of reunification and optimal duration, and had a less favourable view of
   residential care. No significant group differences, however, were found
   in the risk assessments or removal recommendations. Four attitudes were
   associated with the recommendation not to remove: negative attitudes
   towards removal, positive attitudes towards parental participation in
   the decision, positive attitudes towards children's participation in the
   decision, and positive attitudes towards speedy reunification.
   Professional status and experience did not moderate these associations.
   The authors urge examination of professionals' post-graduation training
   and supervision in order to determine whether the role of attitudes in
   professionals' risk assessment might be further reduced.}},

Abstract = {{The Decision Making Ecology provided a framework for empirically testing
   the impact of Case, Caseworker and Organizational factors on the
   decision to place children in out-of-home care. The structural equation
   model we developed fit the data extremely well, indicating a complex
   relationship between the variables. The main findings indicate that Case
   factors, even as aggregated to the worker level, were of most
   importance: Percent Removed was increased in part by greater average
   Risk being assessed and more families on a worker's caseload being Low
   Income. Furthermore, removal rates were increased by lower proportions
   of Hispanic families on the caseload, as well as lower organizational
   support, and a perception of manageable workload and sufficient
   resources. Individual factors, i.e., variables characterizing the
   caseworkers themselves, were not found to directly influence the
   placement decision, including workers' own race/ethnicity, though
   various orders of mediated effects were indicated, and these are
   detailed. Interrelationships between variables that affect case,
   caseworker and organizational factors are discussed along with
   implications for practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When children come to the attention of the child welfare system, they
   become involved in a decision-making process in which decisions are made
   that have a significant effect on their future and well-being. The
   decision to remove children from their families is particularly complex;
   yet surprisingly little is understood about this decision-making
   process. This paper presents the results of a study to develop an
   instrument to explore, at the caseworker level, the context of the
   removal decision, with the objective of understanding the influence of
   the individual and organizational factors on this decision, drawing from
   the Decision Making Ecology as the underlying rationale for obtaining
   the measures. The instrument was based on the development of
   decision-making scales used in prior decision-making studies and
   administered to child protection caseworkers in several states. Analyses
   included reliability analyses, principal components analyses, and
   inter-correlations among the resulting scales. For one scale regarding
   removal decisions, a principal components analysis resulted in the
   extraction of two components, jointly identified as caseworkers'
   decision-making orientation, described as (1) an internal reference to
   decision-making and (2) an external reference to decision-making.
   Reliability analyses demonstrated acceptable to high internal
   consistency for 9 of the 11 scales. Full details of the reliability
   analyses, principal components analyses, and inter-correlations among
   the seven scales are discussed, along with implications for practice and
   the utility of this instrument to support the understanding of
   decision-making in child welfare. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Decision-making in the child protection system is influenced by multiple
   factors; agency and geographic contexts, caseworker attributes, and
   families' unique circumstances all likely play a role. In this study, we
   use the second cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent
   Well-Being to explore how these factors are associated with two key case
   decisions substantiation and removal to out-of-home care. Analyses are
   conducted using weighted hierarchical linear models. We find that
   substantiation is strongly influenced by agency factors, particularly
   constraints on service accessibility. Substantiation is less likely when
   agencies can provide services to unsubstantiated cases and when
   collaboration with other social institutions is high. This supports the
   concept that substantiation may be a gateway to services in some
   communities. Agency factors contributed less to the probability of
   removal among substantiated cases, though time resources and constraints
   on decision-making had some influence. For both substantiation and
   removal risks, county, caseworker, and child characteristics were less
   influential than agency characteristics and family risk factors. (C)

Abstract = {{Child welfare professionals regularly make crucial decisions that have a
   significant impact on children and their families. The present study
   presents the Judgments and Decision Processes in Context model (JUDPIC)
   and uses it to examine the relationships between three independent
   domains: case characteristic (mother's wish with regard to removal),
   practitioner characteristic (child welfare attitudes), and protective
   system context (four countries: Israel, the Netherlands, Northern
   Ireland and Spain); and three dependent factors: substantiation of
   maltreatment, risk assessment, and intervention recommendation. The
   sample consisted of 828 practitioners from four countries. Participants
   were presented with a vignette of a case of alleged child maltreatment
   and were asked to determine whether maltreatment was substantiated,
   assess risk and recommend an intervention using structured instruments.
   Participants' child welfare attitudes were assessed. The case
   characteristic of mother's wish with regard to removal had no impact on
   judgments and decisions. In contrast, practitioners' child welfare
   attitudes were associated with substantiation, risk assessments and
   recommendations. There were significant country differences on most
   measures. The findings support most of the predictions derived from the
   JUDPIC model. The significant differences between practitioners from
   different countries underscore the importance of context in child
   protection decision making. Training should enhance practitioners'
   awareness of the impact that their attitudes and the context in which
   they are embedded have on their judgments and decisions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to identify the themes Social Workers regard
   as important in supporting decisions to remove children from, or return
   them to, the care of their parents. To further elicit underlying
   hypotheses that are discernible in interpretation of evidence. A case
   study, comprising a two-part vignette with a questionnaire, recorded
   demographic information, child welfare attitudes and risk assessments,
   using scales derived from standardised instruments, was completed by 202
   Social Workers in Northern Ireland. There were two manipulated
   variables, mother's attitude to removal and child's attitude to
   reunification 2 years later. In this paper we use data derived from
   respondents' qualitative comments explaining their reasoning for in and
   out of home care decisions. Some 60.9\% of respondent's chose the
   parental care option at part one, with 94\% choosing to have the child
   remain in foster care at part two. The manipulated variables were found
   to have no significant statistical effect. However, three underlying
   hypotheses were found to underpin decisions; (a) child rescue, (b)
   kinship defence and (c) a hedged position on calculation of risk subject
   to further assessment. Reasoning strategies utilised by social workers
   to support their decision making suggest that they tend to selectively
   interpret information either positively or negatively to support
   pre-existing underlying hypotheses. This finding is in keeping with the
   literature on `confirmation bias.' The research further draws attention
   to the need to incorporate open questions in quantitative studies, to
   help guard against surface reading of data, which often does not `speak
   for itself.' (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using a Decision-Making Ecology (DME) approach and proportional hazards
   models, the study isolated four case factor profiles that interacted
   strongly with race and resulted in disparate reunification outcomes for
   African American children compared with Anglos. The four interrelated
   factors were drug involvement, a solo infant case, single mothers, and
   relative placements. A cohort of 21,763 children from the Texas
   Department of Family and Protective Services who were placed for the
   first time in care, who were under 13 and either Anglo or African
   American were followed for 20 months or more post entry into care.
   Starting with an initial model consisting of main effects only and
   consistent with other studies, African American children had a 12\%
   lower hazard rate of reunification compared to Anglo children. However,
   when a set of case profiles involving combinations of single parents,
   single infants, drug involvements and kinship placements were crossed
   with race, the magnitude of the effect of race on hazard rates fanned
   out from no difference to as much as 68\% that of Anglo children. The
   results show that racial disparities in outcomes resulting from complex,
   contextual decision making cannot be modeled well with simple main
   effects models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of papers using data from the Canadian Incidence Study of
   Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS) explored the influence of
   clinical and organizational characteristics on the decision to place
   Aboriginal children in out-of-home placements at the conclusion of child
   maltreatment investigations. The purpose of this paper is to further
   explore a consistent finding of the previous analyses: the proportion of
   investigations involving Aboriginal children at a child welfare agency
   is associated with placement for all children in that agency. CIS-2008
   data were used in the analysis, which allowed for inclusion of
   previously unavailable organizational and contextual variables.
   Multi-level statistical models were developed to analyze the influence
   of clinical and organizational variables on the placement decision.
   Final models revealed that the proportion of investigations conducted by
   the child welfare agency involving Aboriginal children was again a key
   agency-level predictor of the placement decision for any child served by
   the agency. Specifically, the higher the proportion of investigations of
   Aboriginal children, the more likely placement was to occur for any
   child. Further, this analysis demonstrated that structure of governance,
   an organizational-level variable not available in previous cycles of the
   CIS, is an important agency-level predictor of out-of-home placement.
   Further analysis is needed to fully understand individual and
   organizational level variables that may influence decisions regarding
   placement of Aboriginal children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Little is known about decision-making regarding the reunification of
   children in care, or about the consequences of these decisions for the
   children concerned. This study compared decision-making and outcomes for
   149 maltreated children in seven English authorities (68 reunified, 81
   who remained in care). Children were followed up six months after their
   return home or, for those who were not reunified, six months after the
   `effective decision' that they should remain in care. They were followed
   up again four years (on average) after the return or effective decision.
   Data were extracted from case files at baseline and six month followup
   and were gathered from surveys of social workers and teachers at final
   follow-up. The two key predictors of reunification were assessments that
   parental problems had improved and that risks to the child were not
   unacceptably high. Two-thirds returned to improved family circumstances,
   sometimes due to a change in the household they returned to, but others
   were reunified despite persisting concerns. However 35\% re-entered care
   within six months and 63\% re-entered at some point during the four-year
   follow-up period, often due to recurring abuse or neglect. At final
   follow-up remaining in care was the strongest predictor of positive
   outcomes on a range of dimensions, even once children's characteristics
   and histories were taken into account. Outcomes were especially poor for
   neglected children who were reunified, irrespective of whether
   reunification was stable or unstable. Results show the potential of the
   care system to produce positive outcomes for maltreated children. (C)

Abstract = {{Whether the decision-making process for children at risk is biased
   against families from lower socio-economic or minority statuses remains
   a vexing question for social work practice and research. This study
   successfully isolates the subjective decision-making process and the
   intervening effect of overexposure of disadvantaged families to the
   welfare system by utilising a vignette-based factorial survey. The
   vignettes were drawn from actual welfare files of high, low and
   ambiguous risk and then edited to correspond with the experimental
   manipulation. One hundred and five child welfare case workers were asked
   to evaluate the vignettes, as follows: (i) to assess the level of risk
   to the child ('subjective risk') and (ii) to decide whether they would
   recommend out-of-home placement. Children of minority and low
   socio-economic groups were more likely to be assessed as being at risk
   and were more likely to be removed from the home. Furthermore, even for
   the vignettes of high `objective risk', after statistically controlling
   for the subjective risk assessment, families from a low socio-economic
   background were more likely to have their children removed from home.
   Important implications to social work practice and education which
   emerge from this innovative study are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Child protection practitioners are frequently presented with the
   challenges of making decisions that have considerable impact on the
   lives of children and their families. Research in this area has
   primarily focussed on intake, investigation and reunification decisions,
   and reflects the importance of considering the role of the decision
   maker and the decision making environment in decision making. Despite
   over 43,000 children living in out of home care in Australia at June 30,
   2014, the decision making processes leading to finding children safe and
   secure long-term out of home placements are considerably
   under-researched. This study aimed to develop a tool based on the theory
   of planned behaviour framework, measuring the theoretical determinants
   of practitioner behaviour; attitudes, subjective norms and perceived
   behavioural control, in order to examine the intention of child
   protection practitioners about placing children in out of home care. The
   resulting measure, the Child Placement Questionnaire (CPQ), was
   evaluated by experts and piloted with a sample of 53 child protection
   practitioners working in the Australian out of home care sector.
   Individual items were reviewed for their relevance. Participant
   responses reflected a positive intention to place children in kinship
   care, but highlighted the importance of pragmatic constraints when
   placing children. Future research should focus on psychometric
   evaluation of the measure with a larger sample. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Professional judgment in complex clinical situations such as the
   assessment of suicide risk encompasses a multifaceted cognitive
   understanding of the substantive issues, technical expertise, and
   emotional awareness. This experimental design study investigated the
   degree to which the previous work-related experiences of clinicians and
   their preexisting emotional state influence professional judgment
   regarding acute risk in patients presenting with suicidal ideation.
   Experienced social workers and social work students conducted suicide
   risk assessments on 2 standardized patients performing in scenarios
   constructed to depict individuals presenting with suicidal ideation.
   This study revealed significant variations in clinical judgments of
   practitioners assessing suicide risk. While scores on standardized risk
   assessment measures were the strongest predictor of judgments regarding
   the need for hospitalization to ensure the safety of the patient, other
   influences included clinician age and levels of posttraumatic stress
   symptoms. Mental health clinicians and organizations that employ them
   should be aware of possible individual influences on professional
   judgments related to suicide risk.}},

   were conducted utilizing a sub-sample from LONGSCAN (Longitudinal
   Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect) of 942 children and their primary
   caregivers. Results demonstrate that there are important predictors for
   entry into out-of-home placement across multiple ecological domains.
   Characteristics related to child, caregiver, and family characteristics,
   and neighborhood context, as well as dimensions of maltreatment
   (particularly emotional maltreatment), predicted risk of placement in
   out-of-home care. Implications for child welfare practice are discussed.
   This examination of the effects of multiple ecological domains adds to
   our understanding of children's risk of removal and entry into
   out-of-home placement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design was used to examine the potential
   influence of race (African American vs. Caucasian), socioeconomic status
   of the foster care environment (Low vs. High), and System of Care (SOC)
   services (System of Care/Wraparound Services vs. Treatment as Usual) on
   social workers' placement decisions within the child welfare system. Two
   hundred thirty-one social workers from Illinois (86.8\% female, 85.4\%
   European-American; mean age of 50.6 years) read a vignette of a child in
   foster care and were asked to recommend whether the child should remain
   in his current community-based foster care placement or be stepped up to
   a residential placement. Workers then completed a demographic form and
   rated the child's clinical and treatment needs. No main effects of race,
   SES of the foster care environment, or treatment history on placement
   decisions were found. Subsequent exploratory analyses indicated that
   clinical factors, environmental factors, participants' experience in
   child welfare, and vignette condition interacted in nuanced ways to
   predict placement recommendations. While clinical variables were the
   primary factors that social workers considered when making placement
   decisions, the decisions were also be influenced by perceptions of the
   availability of community and family resources. Future research should
   consider using more open-ended approaches in order to further assess the
   processes by which social workers make placement decisions in the child
   welfare system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shared decision-making (SDM), a representation of shared knowledge and
   power between social workers and their clients, is gaining popularity
   and prevalence in social services around the world. In many senses, SDM
   reflects values traditionally associated with social work and service
   provision, such as equality and anti-discrimination. In the complex
   context of social problem-solving, however, the relationship between
   SDM, social workers and their clients is multi-faceted and deserves
   particular attention. The current study examined SDM and the dilemmas it
   entails through interviews conducted in 2012 with 77 Israeli social
   workers and policy makers whose responses were analysed according to the
   guiding principles of descriptive phenomenological content analysis and
   dialogical commonality. Participants' responses represent notions of
   hope, change, identity and choice. Findings are discussed in
   correspondence with current and recent trends in Israeli social
   services, and the social work profession in Israel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is based upon the findings of a qualitative study of how
   child protection social workers and social work managers analyse
   referrals. The study involved interviews with eighteen participants
   based on four vignettes of children potentially at risk of emotional,
   physical or sexual abuse or neglect. Three themes in particular are
   discussed-the balancing of risk, protective and resilience factors; the
   use of family history and the child's wider circumstances; and `known'
   and `unknown' unknowns ('missing information'). These findings are
   considered in relation to the potential use of actuarial risk assessment
   tools or Structured Decisions Making tools in child protection social
   work. The first of two conclusions is that when given adequate space and
   time the participants tended to be to be reflective and analytical, but
   that difficulties remained in their ability to analyse the referrals, in
   particular with the identification of protective or resilience factors
   and in the balancing of risk and protective or resilience factors in
   relation to individual children. The second conclusion is that social
   workers and managers may benefit from assistance in identifying
   protective and resilience factors (and distinguishing between protective
   factors and resilience factors) in particular and this may offer a focus
   for the introduction of structured tools as a way to support current
   practice rather than to replace it.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of risk and safety are central to social work practice with
   survivors of violence against women. Little is known, however, about the
   interaction between child protection workers and the women with whom
   they are working, in terms of their understanding of these concepts or
   how discrepancies between client and worker perceptions may create
   barriers to developing effective intervention strategies. Employing
   grounded theory methodology, focus group and interview data were used to
   explore how both worker and client experiences of the process of risk
   assessment and safety planning influenced the course of the
   intervention. Emergent findings reveal that workers and clients held a
   similar set of beliefs about the social construction/collective
   representation of woman abuse and the work of child protection.
   Specifically, for both, the concept of `doing the right thing' was an
   over-arching theme for understanding how risk and safety are assessed,
   and determining how cases are opened or closed. Findings illustrate how
   narrative structures shape interactions that take place within the
   context of care and prevention, manifesting themselves in complex ways
   that can lead to risks for both clients and workers, in managing
   multiple risks, recognizing the complexity of the concept of safety,
   misunderstanding the impact on children, and the role of men in
   addressing DV in the lives of their children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Documentary analysis of ninety-eight core assessments of children and
   families was used as a means of investigating social workers' cognitive
   decision-making processes. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were
   carried out with the fifty social workers responsible for completing
   these assessments. Particular focus was given to investigating the use
   of experiential and analytical decision making and the effects of case
   and environmental characteristics. Statistical tests and Qualitative
   Comparative Analysis (QCA) were used in order to explore the causal
   mechanisms affecting the decision process. Whilst decision making was
   primarily experiential, relying on social workers' prior casework
   experience and intuition, there was fluidity between modes of cognition.
   Typically, analytical cognition was used as a check or backup to
   experiential decision strategies. Variations in decision-making
   strategies were found due to a range and combination of case
   characteristics and environmental factors. Of particular importance were
   the dynamic nature of the decision environment, whether the family was
   previously known to social services, the level of risk involved, the
   familiarity of the worker with the case type and whether strong evidence
   was needed to support decision making. Implications for social work
   policy and practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents findings from an exploratory qualitative study into
   the factors that influence practitioner decision making in children and
   families social work practice. The findings highlight the complex and
   multi-layered factors which influence decision-making processes. The
   voices of front line practitioners and students on placement provide
   insight into the subtleties and challenges of contemporary practice in
   the UK. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse the data. Core
   categories which emerged included impact of emotions, passing of time
   and strength of voice. The findings indicate a continuum of professional
   development and the significance of time in the learning process.
   Ambivalence about professional voice is interwoven with developing
   expertise, levels of discretion and emotional responses. Similarities
   and differences are indicated between qualified and student
   practitioners. This paper concludes with a consideration of pedagogical
   and practice implications. Models for supervision and critical
   reflection are proposed which could be incorporated more explicitly into
   an integrated practice and academic curriculum for social work.}},

Abstract = {{Building on recent literature that addresses how social workers use
   knowledge to make practice decisions, this ethnographic study of mental
   health workers in a residential treatment center for children asks what
   modes of agency workers enact and how they use formal training in
   Therapeutic Crisis Intervention (TCI) during crises. Based on 13 months
   of participant observation and 36 semistructured interviews, this study
   demonstrates that, while workers routinely employed specific
   intervention techniques taught in the TCI curriculum, they rarely
   reported using its step-by-step decision-making process. Instead, faced
   with an imperative to act, workers reported using a mode of agency
   characterized by what they term ``instinct,{''} automaticity,
   physicality, and instantaneous mental simulation of possible outcomes. I
   discuss these findings in light of Pierre Bourdieu's work on habitus,
   considering implications for crisis intervention training, prescriptive
   models of decision making, and the further development of contextually
   sensitive models of agency in social work practice.}},

Abstract = {{Risk assessment has become a key area of focus for child protection
   practice in recent years. Recent research has begun to identify how risk
   assessment practices and discourses in social work are gendered,
   particularly in relation to parenting and offending. There has been less
   attention paid to how gender impacts upon risk assessment practice with
   young people who present risks to themselves and/or others. This article
   begins to address this gap by exploring some of the findings from a
   recent study of secure accommodation decision-making in Scotland. The
   article examines how risk assessment practices on the part of social
   workers and senior decision makers were influenced by gender discourses.
   The findings highlight the complexities of taking account of gender
   within the risk assessment process and the article concludes by making
   some suggestions for practice. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This study examines judgments made by hospital-based child protection
   teams (CPTs) when determining if there is reasonable suspicion that a
   child has been maltreated, and whether to report the case to a community
   welfare agency, to child protective services (CPS) and/or to the police.
   A prospective multi-center study of all 968 consecutive cases referred
   to CPTs during 2010-2011 in six medical centers in Israel. Centers were
   purposefully selected to represent the heterogeneity of medical centers
   in Israel in terms of size, geographical location and population
   characteristics. A structured questionnaire was designed to capture
   relevant information and judgments on each child referred to the team.
   Bivariate associations and multivariate multinomial logistic regressions
   were conducted to predict whether the decisions would be (a) to close
   the case, (b) to refer the case to community welfare services, or (c) to
   report it to CPS and/or the police. Bivariate and multivariate analyses
   identified a large number of case characteristics associated with higher
   probability of reporting to CPS/police or of referral to community
   welfare services. Case characteristics associated with the decisions
   include socio-demographic (e.g., ethnicity and financial status),
   parental functioning (e.g., mental health), previous contacts with
   authorities and hospital, current referral characteristics (e.g.,
   parental referral vs. child referral), physical findings, and suspicious
   behaviors of child and parent. Most of the findings suggest that
   decisions of CPTs are based on indices that have strong support in the
   professional literature. Existing heterogeneity between cases,
   practitioners and medical centers had an impact on the overall
   predictability of the decision to report. Attending to collaboration
   between hospitals and community agencies is suggested to support
   learning and quality improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BackgroundThere is evidence to suggest that parents with an intellectual
   disability (ID) constitute a higher proportion of child-protective
   services (CPS) cases than would be expected based on the prevalence of
   ID in the general population. Researchers have suggested that the
   stereotypic assumptions and expectations that CPS workers have about
   parents with an ID might influence decisions and responses made to such
   parents. This study examined whether parental ID (having an ID vs. not)
   had an effect on CPS workers' emotional reactions, attributions and
   decisions about risk to the child, whether to remove the child and
   workers' general willingness to help the parent.
   MethodTwo hundred and twelve CPS workers read vignettes describing
   parents who were labelled as either having or not having an ID. Workers
   responded to the vignettes by making ratings of their emotional
   reactions, attributions and decisions regarding risk, removal and
   helping.
   ResultsCPS workers made significantly higher ratings of pity,
   willingness to help and risk for parents with an ID than for parents
   without an ID. Lower ratings of anger and disgust were found for parents
   with an ID than for parents without an ID. Parents' intellectual status
   did not have a direct effect on workers' attributions or removal
   decisions.
   ConclusionsThe results show evidence for the influence of stereotypes
   regarding parental ID due to its differential effect on CPS workers'
   emotional reactions and decisions about child risk and their willingness
   to help.}},

Abstract = {{This article draws on an ethnographic research project that examined how
   New Zealand child protection social workers discussed decision making
   about reported risks for children. The study involved a combination of
   detailed interviews and observations of social work practice in social
   work offices from late 2002 to mid 2003. In this article, I show how the
   initial responses by social workers in statutory child protective
   services were filtered through everyday heuristics about risk as they
   reasoned with harm and danger probabilities. Social workers who
   participated in this study tended to treat risk as something that needed
   to be known early on in the case trajectory. By retaining a focus on
   what was known and recorded and, therefore, could be identified and used
   as the basis of interventions, social workers effectively excluded the
   possibility of a challenge from alternate views or positions about risk.
   Importantly, this approach to risk prevented social workers, their
   supervisors and colleagues from exploring the ways in which risk was
   constructed and used. Thus, they did not consider the extent to which
   social workers decisions, such as those to remove a child exposed
   families to other types of risk, to the potential harm of placing
   children in alternative or foster care.}},

Abstract = {{An important aspect of the uncertainty that surrounds social workers'
   decision-making in child protection situations concerns the complex,
   unconventional nature of the families referred for social work
   interventions. In a study of social work decision-making, social workers
   struggled to make sense of these families and assess whether they were
   safe places for children. More recent sociological studies have
   emphasized the fluidity and diversity of family relationships in late
   modernity. In particular, the study of family practices, which focus on
   what people actually do to actively negotiate their family roles, could
   be a useful way of understanding this complexity and provide social
   workers with a valuable tool for understanding the situations about
   which they must make decisions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws on the findings of a research study that examined the
   factors that influence local decision-making in cases where a child or
   young person is being considered by residential workers, social workers
   and senior managers for placement in a secure unit. After outlining the
   research problem and case study approach taken, the paper focuses on
   explicating the findings of the study that relate to the impact of group
   membership, goals, roles and norms on group performance in such cases.
   The paper illustrates how attending to these four areas, and the way in
   which power relations impact on them, may help those developing and
   managing groups to improve decision-making practice.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the extent to which disparities exist at specific decision
   points within the child welfare system is essential to addressing
   disproportionality if and where it exists. Over the past decade, several
   studies have examined substantiation rates of alleged child maltreatment
   reports among the major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. However,
   Latinos have typically been treated as a monolithic group with
   comparisons limited to children of other races due to limitations
   inherent to child welfare administrative data. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of
   Latino children who come to the attention of the child welfare system by
   parental nativity subgroup, and to examine the relationship of parental
   nativity to substantiation in the U.S. Latino child welfare population.
   The sample included children of Hispanic background who participated the
   second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW II) for
   whom information regarding parental nativity was available for at least
   one biological parent (n = 713). In the final logistic regression model,
   mixed nativity families had significantly lower odds of substantiation
   (OR .44) when compared to US. born families. Odds of substantiation were
   significantly higher in families without a supportive secondary
   caregiver (OR 2.66). Allegations made by professionals (OR 6.15) and
   ``other{''} report sources (OR 4.52) had significantly higher odds of
   substantiation when compared to reports made by caregivers, relatives,
   or neighbors. Each unit increase in caseworker-assessed risk to the
   child (OR 1.95) and sufficiency of evidence to substantiate the case (OR
   3.17) increased the odds of substantiation. The lower odds of
   substantiation among maltreatment reports made regarding children in
   mixed nativity families when compared to those of U.S. born families may
   partly relate to the strengths observed among mixed nativity families,
   including a lower prevalence of material hardship and active alcohol and
   drug abuse. Immigrant families demonstrated some of these same
   strengths: however, a higher prevalence of discipline considered
   inappropriate or excessive was also observed within this subgroup.
   Implications for culturally relevant child welfare practice with diverse
   Latino families are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper models racialized perceptions of child welfare workers and
   tests the hypothesis that these perceptions contribute to the racial
   disproportionality in reported and/or substantiated child maltreatment.
   A method is adopted which captures the salient features of racial
   stereotypes deriving from visual representations of neglectful
   situations that meet state definitions of child maltreatment and
   reportable offenses. Caseworkers are shown pictures of a neglectful
   situation that randomly varies with respect to whether a child in the
   picture is black or white or whether there is no child at all pictured.
   If things that ``look black{''} are more likely to be perceived of by
   caseworkers as reportable offenses or to meet state definitions of child
   maltreatment than things that ``look white,{''} then this indicates
   racialized perceptions. Data are collected from a sample of all
   caseworkers from every county in Minnesota for 2005.
   Linear and logistic fixed effects models are estimated for the responses
   as to whether the situation in the picture meets the state definition
   and whether the offense is reportable. Independent variables include:
   the respondent's age, gender, and race; whether the respondent was born
   in the Twin Cities, majored in social work, was an intake worker, or
   worked in Hennepin County. The results show statistically significant
   impacts of the black baby vignette (compared to no baby or white baby)
   on the likelihood that respondents agree that the situation depicted in
   the picture meets the state definition of neglect and is reportable.
   Also estimated are the impacts of these racialized beliefs on racial
   disproportionalities in reported and substantiated child maltreatment
   rates across counties. There are strong and statistically significant
   impacts of indices of caseworker racialized beliefs on racial
   disproporationalities in reported and substantiated maltreatment rates.

Abstract = {{Introduction: The assessment of children at risk of abuse and neglect is
   a critical societal function performed by child protection workers in
   situations of acute stress and conflict. Despite efforts to improve the
   reliability of risk assessments through standardized measures, available
   tools continue to rely on subjective judgment. The goal of this study
   was to assess the stress responses of child protection workers and their
   assessments of risk in high conflict situations.
   Methods: Ninety-six child protection workers participated in 2 simulated
   scenarios, 1 non-confrontational and 1 confrontational. In each
   scenario, participants conducted a 15-minute interview with a mother
   played by a specially trained actor. Following the interview, the
   workers completed 2 risk assessment measures used in the field at the
   time of the study. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety
   Inventory at baseline and immediately following the completion of each
   interview. Physiological stress as measured by salivary cortisol was
   obtained at baseline as well as 20 and 30 minutes after the start of
   each interview.
   Results: Participants demonstrated significant stress responses during
   the 1st scenario, regardless of whether the interview was
   confrontational or not. During the second scenario, the participants did
   not exhibit significant cortisol responses, however the confrontational
   interview elicited greater subjective anxiety than the
   non-confrontational scenario. In the first scenario, in which the
   workers demonstrated greater stress responses, risk assessment scores
   were higher on one risk assessment tool for the confrontational scenario
   than for the non-confrontational scenario.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that stress responses in child
   protection workers appear to be influenced by the novelty of a situation
   and by a parent's demeanor during interviews. Some forms of risk
   assessment tools appear to be more strongly associated than other with
   the workers' subjective and physiological stress responses. This merits
   further research to determine which aspects of risk assessment tools are
   susceptible to the emotional elements of intake interviews. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Concern about the decision-making abilities of practitioners in child
   protection has led to the development and implementation of increasingly
   structured assessment tools, many based on forms of risk assessment. The
   positive and negative effects of such tools on practice have been widely
   researched and debated. This paper presents the findings from
   ethnographic research about the use of a particular set of
   decision-making tools that provide insights into how tools might affect
   the professional development of practitioners. The overall finding that
   the use of decision-making tools may impair professional development
   draws attention to the importance of the process of implementation, in
   particular how tools are regarded within an organization in relation to
   practitioner expertise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the reasoning processes of social workers in
   child protection social work as they make decisions. Within this
   interpretive process, they assign meaning to clients' behaviours in a
   context containing a multitude of competing discourses relating to the
   nature and cause of clients' problems. The study used a qualitative
   approach, specifically a critical incident framework. It asked workers
   to describe cases they felt `pleased with' and explain the reasoning
   processes they used in those cases. It also asked clients their views of
   decisions made about them. This article draws on social constructionist
   theorising to describe and analyse the discourses used to frame the aims
   of practice and the causes of clients' problems. It found that workers
   valued family maintenance and sought to bolster this while managing
   potential risk. In the cases selected by workers, they constructed the
   causes of clients' problems in non-blaming but individualised ways,
   viewed clients as being capable of change and honest in their dealings
   with workers. It is proposed that these ways of viewing contributed to
   maintaining relationships with clients despite the challenges of
   balancing risk, care, control and power.}},

Abstract = {{Some ethnic and racial minority groups, as well as families living in
   poverty, are overrepresented in the child welfare system. It is
   important to understand how issues of socioeconomic status and race
   enter into child protection decisions. This research used a factorial
   survey method to look at the influence of race and poverty on child
   protection decision making. Participants were asked to make decisions
   about the severity of risk, service provision and the importance of a
   home visit on fictitious, but unique, vignettes in which the independent
   variables were randomly assigned. The finding was that race and poverty
   were not statistically significant in any of the decisions made. Rather,
   it was other factors of disadvantage, such as substandard housing,
   spousal violence and substance use, that impact decision making. A
   possible explanation for this finding is that child protection work with
   its reductionist and individualistic perspective obscures the context of
   people's lives. The increasingly technocratic discourse in child
   protection blames individual parents and holds them responsible for not
   protecting their child from vulnerability, regardless of any historical
   and structural impediments they may face in attaining adequate
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined the threshold at which multidisciplinary
   child protection team (CPT) professionals substantiate physical abuse
   allegations and the extent that they utilize potentially biased
   constructs in their decision making when presented with the same case
   evidence. State legal definitions of child maltreatment are broad.
   Therefore, the burden of interpretation is largely on CPT professionals
   who must determine at what threshold physical acts by parents surpass
   corporal discipline and constitute child physical abuse. Biased or
   subjective decisions may be made if certain case-specific
   characteristics or CPT professionals' personal characteristics are used
   in making physical abuse determinations. Case vignettes with visual
   depictions of inflicted injuries were sent to CPT professionals in
   Florida and their substantiation decisions, personal beliefs about
   corporal discipline, and coercive discipline were collected. Results of
   the study demonstrated relatively high agreement among professionals
   across vignettes about what constitutes physical abuse. Further. CPT
   professionals strongly considered their perceptions of the severity of
   inflicted injuries in substantiation decisions. Although case specific
   characteristics did not bias decisions in a systematic way, some CPT
   professional characteristics influenced the substantiation of physical
   abuse. Practice implications and future directions of research are
   discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Child welfare agencies have moved toward standardized risk
   assessment measures to improve the reliability with which child's risk
   of abuse is predicted. Nevertheless, these tools require a degree of
   subjective judgment. Research to date has not substantially investigated
   the influence of specific context and worker characteristics on
   professional judgment in the use of risk assessment measures. Method:
   This research utilized standardized patients performing in scenarios to
   depict typical child welfare cases. Ninety-six workers interviewed two
   ``families,{''} completed risk assessment measures, and then
   participated in interviews regarding their subjective views of their
   decision making and performance. Results: There was considerable
   variability in risk appraisals. Confidence in risk assessment
   performance was related to age, acute level of stress, and the worker's
   perceived ability to engage family members. Confidence in risk
   assessment was further related to case variables. Confidence was not
   related to level of risk assessed. Conclusion: The variation in risk
   assessment appraisals in this study, despite at times high rates of
   worker confidence in their appraisals, speaks to the need for ongoing
   consultation and increased decision support strategies even among highly
   skilled and trained workers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses growing professional discontents with the
   increasing formalisation of social work practice exerted through systems
   of risk management and audit. Drawing on an ESRC-funded study of social
   work practices in children's statutory services, this paper provides a
   critique of instrumental approaches to risk management in social work.
   Through the discussion of three illustrative case examples, we argue
   that risk management is an inherently complex, contingent and negotiated
   activity. Social work practitioners are obliged to comply with risk
   reduction technologies, but informal processes continue to play a
   critical role in shaping decisions and actions in this
   relationship-based profession. From practitioner accounts, we identify
   key elements of the informal logics of risk management. We conclude that
   the bureaucratic-instrumental bias manifest in the modernisation of
   children's services, in privileging metrics and administrative power
   leaves the informal and relational aspects of practice under-emphasised
   and under-theorised. Suggestions are made about how practice might be
   advanced in the complex world of child welfare and protection.}},

   evidence-based knowledge in decision-making and what would be important
   resources for improving availability, access and utilization of
   evidence-based knowledge in decision-making? Our results indicate that
   respondents relied most heavily on experience; on their professional
   values and beliefs, and on an empathic understanding of their clients'
   uniqueness. Compared to these sources of information use of research and
   the professional literature were less enthusiastically endorsed.}},

Abstract = {{Substantiation can have an important effect on what interventions are
   pursued for children investigated for maltreatment, but researchers lack
   knowledge about how the decision to substantiate is made. Using
   information from 4,515 children from a national probability study of
   children investigated for maltreatment, this study examined how
   caseworker judgments of harm, risk, and evidence predicted
   substantiation. The substantiation rate was 29.9\%, but the majority of
   cases were substantiated when caseworkers reported at least moderate
   harm, at least moderate risk, and/or probably to clearly sufficient
   evidence. Each judgment variable significantly predicted substantiation
   in a multivariable model, with evidence the strongest predictor. Child
   gender and age were significant predictors beyond harm, risk, and
   evidence, suggesting that other judgments also influence substantiation.
   In 9 of 100 cases, reports were not substantiated despite moderate to
   severe harm. Thus, substantiation is generally based on judgments of
   harm, risk, and evidence but not exclusively. The findings underline
   previous researchers' conclusions that substantiation is a flawed
   measure of child maltreatment and suggest that policy and practice
   related to substantiation are due for a fresh appraisal by state child
   welfare service agencies.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in ratings of the severity of risk for children involved in
   the child welfare system among less experienced and more experienced
   social workers are examined. Sixty-three social workers from a south
   western Ontario CAS participated: twenty-seven with less than three
   years of experience and thirty-six with more than three years of
   experience. Social workers read two scenarios and were asked to
   determine the extent of risk present to the child and indicate if that
   child should be taken into care. The findings indicate that social
   workers with different levels of experience do not differ in their
   perceptions of risk and in their decisions with regards to managing risk
   in the community. Increases in the number of children taken into care is
   not attributable to differential decision making based on experience.

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Researchers conduct secondary analysis of data collected in
   community-based focus groups convened to analyze key decision points
   where racial disproportionality grew wider in child welfare. Analysis
   confirms findings of other research pointing to referral bias, unclear
   or problematic policies related to engaging kin, the confounding role of
   poverty, and racial disparities in the availability of services to
   ameliorate family problems. A new finding suggested by this work was
   that lack of professional awareness of the influence of bias is in and
   of itself a barrier. Authors assert that professionals who believe the
   court system is fair and rational will not be vigilant in seeking out
   checks and balances to racial bias and may also be less likely to seek
   training or consciousness-raising experiences to address their own bias.
   The research methodology used serves as an example of ways
   university-based researchers can team with community-based action
   planning coalitions to stimulate systems change. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Studies have found that certain racial groups, particularly the children
   of African American families, are placed in foster care at a higher rate
   than children of other races. These families are also sometimes found to
   be afforded fewer services that might prevent these removals, relative
   to families of other races. It is unclear why this is so. Poverty has
   been suspected, and sometimes found, to be the primary cause of the
   disparity. Lacking in some of these analyses, however, was how risk of
   future abuse/neglect to the child entered into the decisions and
   particularly, how assumptions about race, poverty, and risk are factored
   into the decision-making process. It is important to understand this
   process if we are to find a way to correct it. The current study
   addresses this process.}},

Abstract = {{The study examines how child protection workers risk assessments and
   recommendations on removal and reunification of children at risk are
   influenced by the child and mother wishes regarding removal and
   associated with the workers' own attitudes towards key issues in child
   protection - removal, reunification, duration of alternative care, and
   perceived quality of out of home placements. Two hundred child
   protection workers in Israel completed the `Child Welfare Attitudes
   Questionnaire' and provided their risk assessments and recommendation
   regarding case vignettes presented by the authors. Cluster analyses
   identified two groups: a `pro-removal' group and a more `anti-removal'
   group. The former made higher risk assessments and recommended removal
   significantly more than the latter. Removal and reunification
   recommendations were not associated with the child's nor the mother's
   wishes. Workers in both groups tended not to recommend reunification
   after a year in out of home care, even if they initially were against
   removal. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Professionals encountering possible cases of child neglect face a
   complex task when judging whether a particular concern warrants a
   referral to social work services. A study of referral practice in cases
   of child neglect, completed in the Republic of Ireland, highlighted that
   it is not just the nature of the concern that influences referral
   practice but a range of other factors that are not related to the needs
   of the specific child. Assessment frameworks and tools, designed to
   assist practitioners make decisions about potential cases of neglect,
   usually focus on technical-rational activity associated with assessing
   children's needs, parenting capacity and family and environmental
   factors. The findings from the study described in this paper indicate
   that assessment practice is as much a practice-moral activity as a
   technical-rational one. In other words, it is both a head and a heart
   activity. In this article, the factors influencing practitioners'
   approaches to the identification and referral of cases of child neglect
   are explored. A range of factors appear to influence practice. These
   include the practitioner's own perception of what comprises neglect and
   the extent to which they use `gut reaction' or an evidence base to reach
   this conclusion. Their interpretation of role and the views of their
   colleagues and team manager also influence practice. In addition, their
   perception of social work services and the benefits of referral affect
   decisions to refer. Finally, their own personal feelings such as fear,
   guilt, over-empathy and anxiety about the response of the community have
   an effect on practice. The paper concludes by drawing together the
   findings of the study to produce a `practitioner domain' alerting
   practitioners and managers to the head and heart activities which
   influence referral practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on an analysis of the transcripts of four focus
   groups involving social workers from four English social work teams
   working with children and families. In the groups, social workers
   discussed the process of coming to a decision in care proceedings (where
   decisions are made about the future care of a child where there are
   concerns about the care provided in the family of origin). It explores
   how social workers described themselves coming to conclusions about
   cases, and how they perceive the courts as doing so. Noting the need in
   such important proceedings both for thoroughness and for speed (for
   delay is likely to be harmful to children in need of a secure home), the
   authors consider ways in which decision-making might be distorted or
   delayed and discuss the perception of the social workers that some kinds
   of evidence are under- or overvalued by the courts. The authors conclude
   that, while it may seem that there is a trade-off between thoroughness
   and speed, this is not always the case and that factors that cause poor
   decision-making can also cause delay.}},

Abstract = {{Reception and initial contact arrangements and practices in social
   services play a key role in safeguarding children and providing an
   avenue for the public and professionals to report concerns about a
   child's welfare. This paper reports on findings from a small-scale
   study, commissioned in the wake of the Laming Inquiry into the
   circumstances surrounding the death of Victoria Climbie. The aim of the
   study was an exploration of the arrangements local authorities had in
   place in early 2004 to receive referrals from the public and
   professional sources, and to report on duty team managers' levels of
   satisfaction with these arrangements. It drew on interviews with 70
   social work managers responsible for daytime and out-of-hours duty
   services in 28 English local authorities. The authors argue that, while
   the Inquiry recommendations to improve the organisation of initial
   contact with social services in the event of concerns about a child's
   welfare remain important, wide variations exist in practice. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of possible contributory factors for such
   variation, and policy and practice measures that could address the
   variation.}},

Abstract = {{The authors examined the thinking processes in the use of a decision
   support system (DSS) by social workers in a human services agency to
   determine whether they used the system to improve their case reasoning.
   Information was obtained from in-depth interviews with eight social
   workers who used a DSS in their work and from content analysis of
   ``narrative justifications{''} appended to 1,074 decisions that differed
   from those recommended by the DSS. Findings show that the social workers
   used the DSS in a perfunctory manner in typical cases, but as an aid to
   thinking and reflection in atypical cases, in which they were uncertain
   of how to decide. On the whole, the social workers showed little
   interest in the DSSs recommendations, but reported that the process of
   entering data and answering the model's questions about the case were
   useful when the case was atypical. The authors suggest that computer
   support systems should be designed to help workers think through
   atypical cases.}},

Abstract = {{This is a prospective, longitudinal study of the psychological,
   physical, social and cultural quality of life of 93 children at risk who
   were removed from home or kept at home. Assessments were made by social
   workers who made the decisions, at three points of time. The findings
   show that the quality of life of the children who were removed from home
   improved incrementally over the 15 months, while that of the children
   who stayed at home remained at the same low level as at the first
   measure. The findings suggest that removing children at risk from
   abusive or neglectful homes can improve their quality of life, while
   leaving them in such homes generally does not. Pending further research
   on larger samples and using multiple sources of information, they also
   suggest that it may be worth reexamining current policy on removal. (C)

Abstract = {{This study examined whether social workers' decisions on removal could
   be predicted by features of the children, the parents, and the
   children's quality of life as the workers perceive and assess them at
   the beginning of their decision making process. The Study was carried
   out on 99 children at risk, between three and thirteen years old, most
   of whom suffered from neglect and/or psychological injury. The findings
   show that the examined features of the parents and children had only
   limited predictive power and the early quality of life assessments
   none-even though quality of life assessments made after the decision (on
   a different but analogous group of children) did distinguish between
   children that the workers decided to remove and those they decided to
   keep at home. The low predictive power of the studied variables suggests
   that the information available to social workers at the beginning of the
   process is inadequate For making decisions on removal and that time is
   needed to gather the information they need. The study findings also
   contribute to Our understanding of the ``gray area{''} in which most
   children who come to the attention of social set-vice agencics are
   located.}},

Abstract = {{The study in this article examined the decision-making process of a
   child protection team (CPT) charged with reporting suspected child abuse
   in a medical center in Israel. The authors focused on the decision
   whether to conclude that a child was at imminent risk and whether to
   refer the case to a child protection officer. The authors analyzed the
   content of 139 case files of the children examined by the CPT in two
   consecutive years, recorded the case characteristics, and correlated
   them with the decision in a series of univariate and multivariate
   analyses. The findings indicate that the characteristics of the family
   were stronger predictors of the decision than the characteristics of the
   child and of the event that brought the child to the hospital.
   Implications of the findings and future research issues are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The study explores why social workers do not always
   implement their decisions to remove children at risk from their homes.
   Method: Social workers in Israel filled out questionnaires for 96
   children at risk at two points of time: When they began to consider
   whether or not to remove the child, they completed questionnaires
   tapping their own, the parents', and the children's features. Six months
   later, they reported their decision, whether or not they had carried it
   out, and if not, why not.
   Results: Some 21\% of the workers' decisions were not implemented,
   almost all of them decisions to remove. The main reasons given were the
   objections of the parents and/or the child. Decisions were implemented
   for all the children whose mothers were alcohol or drug addicts.
   Implementation was lower for older children, children who were
   uncooperative with the social worker, and for children whose parents
   were uncooperative. It was also lower among experienced workers than
   novices.
   Conclusions: Further study is required to examine the generalizability
   of these findings to other countries, to understand better the reasons
   for the non-implementation, and to follow-up on the consequences of the
   non-implementation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the structure and content of rationales given by
   social work professionals for risk assessments and recommendations they
   make with regard to cases of children at risk. We compare professionals
   in Canada and in Israel. We used convenience samples of 52 social
   workers from Israel and 67 from Canada. The participants reviewed a case
   vignette, indicated their assessment of risk and their recommended
   intervention. They provided rationales for their risk assessment and
   recommendation. We analysed the structure and content of these
   rationales. We used Toulmin's (Toulmin et al., 1984) framework to
   analyse the structure of arguments, and Rosen's (1994) categories were
   used to classify the content of their rationales. We found that most
   workers provided basic level arguments but did not supply complementary
   level arguments (missing in particular were qualifying and rebuttals).
   Workers said that they relied mostly on theory, general knowledge, and
   experience. They rarely mentioned values or policy as the foundations of
   their claims, and never cited empirical knowledge in the backing up of
   their arguments. Canadian and Israeli workers shared similar patterns.
   The most striking differences were that Canadian workers tended to
   mention theory and experience more than the Israelis who tended to
   mention general knowledge to back up their arguments. Canadian workers
   also used fewer warrants, backing responses, and qualifiers to support
   their claims. The limitations of the study and its implications for
   training and education are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this research was to study how different groups
   of child welfare professionals prioritize and use information to make
   placement decisions following instances of child abuse.
   Method: A total of 90 juvenile court judges and guardians ad litem,
   Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), social workers, and mental
   health professionals responded to a detailed questionnaire describing
   four case studies of child physical abuse in which a parent was the
   perpetrator, the child was either 2 years or 6 years of age, and the
   abuse was either first time or chronic. Participants rated the impact of
   specific pieces of information regarding child, family, and system-level
   characteristics on their decision-making process.
   Results: Analyses of reactions to these vignettes demonstrate that
   professional groups use different kinds of information when making
   decisions about foster care placements. Social workers and mental health
   providers rely on information about the severity and pattern of abuse
   and on information about services offered in the past and parental
   responses to those services. Judges and guardians ad litem rely more
   heavily on information about the likelihood of a reoccurrence of abuse
   and the child's ability to recount the abuse, whereas CASA volunteers
   rely on information about the stability of the family.
   Conclusions: Professional group membership, rather than factors such as
   age or ethnicity of the child or chronicity of abuse, accounts for
   different patterns of prioritizing and using information when making
   decisions about whether a child should remain in the home or be placed
   in foster care. The implications for community-based training and
   intervention efforts are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The decision to reunify children with their substance-affected parent is
   highly complex and requires a tremendous amount of work and change on
   the part of the affected parent. This exploratory study identified
   indicators for safe reunification of children placed in foster care due
   to parental substance abuse. fudges who hear juvenile cases, private
   agency child welfare caseworkers, and substance abuse counselors from a
   large midwestern state were surveyed using an instrument composed of a
   preliminary list of indicators identified through focus groups with
   these professional groups. Responses from 196 professionals who rated
   the importance of each item and subsequent factor analysis resulted in
   identification of 97 indicators. These indicators were grouped into the
   categories of motivation, recovery, competency; and rehability; social
   support; parenting skills; and legal issues. Implications of the
   findings for practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to identify the ways in which decision-makers
   search for information and use it to reach their risk-assessments and
   their recommendations of whether to remove children from home. We
   compare the decision-making process of social work professionals, social
   work trainees and nonprofessionals, and we assess how they are
   influenced by information on physical abuse to the child. We used three
   convenience samples of 100 respondents each: certified social workers
   working toward their second degree, social work trainees, and students
   in the B.A. program in the School of Business Administration. We
   provided subjects with minimal referral information on a case of alleged
   child abuse or maltreatment and asked them to make initial judgments and
   recommendations on the case. We then presented a list of available
   additional information cues about the case. We traced what the
   information cues were that the respondents looked for. We manipulated
   the information provided to respondents: one version described physical
   signs of abuse and the other did not.
   We found that information on signs of physical abuse had significant
   impact on risk-judgments, removal recommendations and information search
   patterns. There were significant differences between the three groups in
   their assessment of risk and recommendations for removal. Furthermore,
   there were certain differences in the ways they selected information.
   Nonprofessionals tended to assess higher risk, recommend removal, and
   were influenced by information on physical abuse more than the other two
   groups. (C) 2002 by The Hawonh Press, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the findings from a study comparing the responses

   support for the hypothesis that providers would see their clients as
   more needy than the clients would see themselves. The analysis also
   suggested support for a second hypothesis that professionals and clients
   would emphasize different needs. In particular, although both groups of
   respondents emphasized information/access and material support issues,
   the groups differed markedly in their perceptions of need for formal
   support services and services to address social participation concerns.
   In general, the professionals were more concerned than their clients
   about personal and family problems, whereas the clients were more
   concerned with universal human needs, such as access to public libraries
   and recreational facilities. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All

   dilemmas, since both remaining in and being removed have strong negative
   psychological repercussions. This article presents an empirical
   investigation of 194 Israeli child protection officers' decisions on 368
   children at risk. Findings showed that while the officers predicted that
   all the children would have a better quality of life outside their
   homes, they removed only those where the projected disparity between the
   alternatives was substantial. That is, they considered not only whether
   one alternative was: better or worse, but how much better or worse.

Abstract = {{This study raised two questions: 1. Are child protection workers'
   decisions as to whether or not to keep children at risk at home
   associated with their expectations of changes in the child's quality of
   life at home? 2. Is the parents' cooperation with the child protection
   officer related to the assessment of the child's quality of life and to
   the decision? The main findings of this paper show a significant
   relationship between the decision to remove children at risk from home
   and both expectations that these children's quality of life is likely to
   deteriorate and assessments of their parents as uncooperative; and,
   conversely, the decision to keep them at home and the expectation that
   their quality of life will improve and the assessment of their parents
   as cooperative.}},

Abstract = {{In the United Kingdom there has been difficulty in implementing the
   family support provisions contained in the 1989 Children Act, largely
   because of continued emphasis on child protection activity by local
   authorities. There is an observable international tendency for
   child-care referrals to receive investigative response, resulting in
   families being traumatized and children's needs left unmet. There has
   been a lack of research into how child-care referrals are initially
   categorized by senior social workers. This paper reports on research
   undertaken in two Health and Social Services Trusts within Northern
   ireland to ascertain if it might be possible to treat more initial
   referrals as `child-care problem enquiries' as opposed to `child
   protection investigations'. Results demonstrate that, while such
   potential may exist, a preoccupation with the management of risk could
   lead to the development of child-care problems receiving quasi-child
   protection responses. Consequently, changes in initial decision making
   may not have the full intended effects in terms of the organizational
   release of resources for family support or a lessening of the traumatic
   impact upon families.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between knowledge and practice has been a long standing
   issue for social work. This is, in part, because, despite the strong
   intuitive appeal of a position which emphasises the importance of
   knowledge, this has yet to be established through research. Part of the
   problem lies with different epistemological positions, and the
   consequent differences in the examination of knowledge application.
   Recently, however, there has been a growth of theoretical interest in
   reflection, reflexivity and cognitive processes as a way of looking at
   social work knowledge. This process knowledge represents a break from
   the past where, despite other differences, writers emphasised `knowledge
   as product', that is given knowledge, already researched and available
   for practice use. Despite impressive theoretical developments, however,
   process knowledge has not been subject to empirical research. This paper
   reports on work which sought to develop categories and concepts for
   process knowledge based on research with social workers. Using a novel
   method, the cognitive processes interview, a number of categories of
   process knowledge were identified related broadly to areas of critical
   appraisal, hypothesis generation and the relationship between the two.
   The paper provides clear evidence of the need for high level cognitive
   abilities for the conduct of practice, and the need to develop
   educational processes which will encourage rigour in relation to these
   cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study examined the relationship between judgements about
   the seriousness of incidents of suspected maltreatment and the reporting
   of those incidents.
   Method: Eighty-six graduate social work students were given 12 vignettes
   depicting problematic parental behaviors. Students were asked to rate
   each vignette according to how serious they perceived the parental
   behavior to be with ``1{''} being ``not serious{''} and ``7{''} bring
   ``very serious.{''} Students were also asked to indicate whether or not
   they would report the incident to child protective services. Data were
   analyzed by case and by individual.
   Results: All 12 vignettes were serious with mean incident ratings
   ranging from a low of 6.0 to a high of 6.9. However, not all incidents
   were reported with similar frequency. Only incidents that were
   collectively very serious were reported by nearly ail respondents
   (Spearman rank order correlation coefficient = .94). Among worker
   characteristics, the worker's judgement of seriousness was thr only
   predictor of reporting.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that beginning human service workers are
   unsure of their legal responsibility to report suspected maltreatment.
   The results also point to a need for closer collaboration between
   mandated reporters and child protective services. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the process of decision making in child
   protection, particularly as it relates to the decision whether or not to
   remove a child from home. The study compared a group of novice social
   workers with expert practitioners, placing a particular focus on the
   types of knowledge that novices draw upon when making such decisions,
   A three-stage, qualitative methodology was employed to investigate child
   protection decision making, All parts of the study utilized a case
   vignette of a neglect scenario. This paper reports on some of the
   findings in respect of the use of theoretical, empirical and procedural
   knowledge.
   The findings suggest that novices tend to lack a clear understanding of
   the factors that are associated with child maltreatment While they have
   a superficial awareness of the concept of risk assessment, they have an
   inability to weigh factors appropriately and to apply this to their
   practice,
   The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to field
   education.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing emphasis being placed on sound reasoning iii
   social work practice, there has been little empirical investigation of
   how practitioners understand this as taking concrete form or how it is
   impeded or facilitated by contextual and environmental factors. This gap
   in knowledge limits supervisors' and administrators' ability to under
   stand and manage environmental variables as these affect direct sei vice
   workers' practice reasoning and decision-making. This article reports a
   study on direct service workers that identifies: (I) what practitioners
   believe constitutes sound reasoning; (2) environmental factors that
   practitioners see as promoting or interfering with sound reasoning; and
   (3) strategies that practitioners believe useful in correcting problems
   in practice reasoning. Implications of these findings for the
   enhancement of sound reasoning, in human service agencies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: An investigation was conducted into whether child protection
   investigators, specifically social workers and the police, are as likely
   to take seriously a case of child sexual abuse if it had been
   perpetrated by a female rather than a male. Also, to examine whether the
   decisions relating to female-perpetrated abuse were predicted by
   participants' sex role perceptions of women and their attitudes
   concerning women's sexualized behavior towards children.
   Method: Participants advocated decisions in response to four
   hypothetical case of child sexual abuse in which the perpetrator was
   either male or female. The female perpetrators were then rated on
   femininity and masculinity characteristics and attitudes concerning
   women's sexualized behavior toward children were assessed.
   Results: Following male-rather than female-perpetrated sexual abuse,
   case registration and imprisonment of the perpetrator was considered
   more appropriate by all participant groups; male social workers also
   considered social services involvement and investigation as more
   appropriate. A substantial number of decisions concerning female
   perpetrated abuse were predicted by participants' attitudes.
   Conclusion: While child protection professionals considered child sexual
   abuse perpetrated by females to be a serious issue warranting
   intervention, a number of advocated decisions suggested that they did
   not consider female-perpetrated abuse to be as serious as
   male-perpetrated abuse. The implication is that victims of sexual abuse
   perpetrated by a woman may be less likely to receive the protection
   afforded victims of male-perpetrated abuse. Furthermore, professionals'
   practices may be inadvertently perpetuating the view that female child
   sexual abuse is rare or less harmful than abuse carried out by males.

Abstract = {{The study investigates the influence of access to information of a
   history of physical maltreatment on the evaluative responding of social
   service and clinical psychology professionals. Written vignettes were
   used in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design to manipulate the: (a)
   presence/absence of abuse history; (b) presence/absence of behavior
   problems; and (c) gender of the child. Professionals rated children
   presented in 12 case vignettes along five treatment-related dimensions:
   (a) overall adjustment; (b) predicted 6 month temporal stability of
   behavior; (c) likelihood of treatment referral; (d) expected home
   intervention success; and (e) expected school intervention success. Four
   dimensions related to social functioning were also rated, including
   likelihood of the child being: (a) recommended to serve as assistant to
   teacher; (b) elected as a school activity team leader; (c) elected as a
   class officer; and (d) nominated as a candidate for successful
   completion of a summer camp program. The findings verified the influence
   of information related to a history of maltreatment on professional
   judgments, despite matched vignette content for all factors other than
   maltreatment status. The results suggests a possible failure to
   recognize that some children have been buffered from the negative
   effects of abuse and point to the risk of erroneous judgments that may
   be directed toward maltreated children. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A survey was undertaken of 701 decisions in `child protection'; and
   `child-care' cases within one local authority. Decision making at four
   filter points in case career was analysed. Filter 1 was when the case
   was initially referred to social services, Filter 2 was when
   consideration was given to holding a case conference, Filter 3 was when
   a case conference was held, and Filter 4 was the review case conference
   following the initial case conference. The major risk factors which
   determined decisions were highlighted, and these were different at each
   filter level. The percentage of children who remained within the `child
   protection system' after decisions were taken at each filter level was
   analysed and recorded. The research found that, based on the risk factor
   weightings given by the independent auditors, workers were appropriately
   discriminating between `child protection' and `child-care' cases.}},

   specifically, their recommendations concerning child custody in cases of

   making their recommendations, custody was seldom awarded to fathers even
   when they were qualified for it. There were indications that the
   subjects were value-biased in their judgments, even in cases in which
   the best interest of the child, as well as the knowledge now available

   is suggested that because the workers were value-biased, their
   professional socialization should be reconsidered.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which social
   workers rely on professional as opposed to nonprofessional criteria in
   their decision-making regarding the quality of mother-child interaction.
   Ninety social workers observed the same video tapes displaying an infant
   interacting with its mother in the Strange Situation procedure, but were
   given different background material regarding the child's family.  A
   third of the subjects received negative background information in
   advance of their viewing the film, another third received positive
   information, and the final third formed a control group and were given
   no advance information.  After viewing the video tapes, subjects were
   asked to assess infant behavior, maternal behaviors and the quality of
   mother-infant relationship.  Results clearly indicated that the social
   workers who were told that the family was neglectful were more inclined
   than the others to describe negatively both the child and the mother as
   well as their relationship.  The findings underscore the need for
   greater awareness among social workers concerning the influence of bias
   involved in professional decision-making.}},
